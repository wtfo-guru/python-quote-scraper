She became a trailblazing advocate for disability rights, and the first person who was deaf and blind to earn a college degree in the United States. She graduated in 1904, at a time when women were significantly outnumbered by men in higher education, special education was in its infancy, and the disability rights movement was just beginning to pick up steam.</p><p>Keller\u2019s mastery of multiple forms of communication, and lifelong activism on behalf of people with disabilities, women, Black people, and other socially sidelined groups, brought her international celebrity. She lectured throughout the U.S. and abroad, and authored 14 books, including a famous memoir published in 1905, <em>The Story of My Life</em>, which was translated into 50 languages and remains in print.</p><p>While Keller embraced the limelight, she did so in order to campaign for fair treatment and equal rights for everyone, regardless of gender, race, or disability. She supported the growth of several major U.S. institutions, including Helen Keller International, the ACLU, and the NAACP. She believed true happiness came from helping and working in partnership with others, aligning oneself with a higher purpose, and from within oneself.</p><p>\u201cWhen one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us,\u201d she <a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/We-Bereaved-Helen-Keller/dp/B002JHIQ9O\\\">wrote</a> in 1929.

She became a trailblazing advocate for disability rights, and the first person who was deaf and blind to earn a college degree in the United States. She graduated in 1904, at a time when women were significantly outnumbered by men in higher education, special education was in its infancy, and the disability rights movement was just beginning to pick up steam.</p><p>Keller\u2019s mastery of multiple forms of communication, and lifelong activism on behalf of people with disabilities, women, Black people, and other socially sidelined groups, brought her international celebrity. She lectured throughout the U.S. and abroad, and authored 14 books, including a famous memoir published in 1905, <em>The Story of My Life</em>, which was translated into 50 languages and remains in print.</p><p>While Keller embraced the limelight, she did so in order to campaign for fair treatment and equal rights for everyone, regardless of gender, race, or disability. She supported the growth of several major U.S. institutions, including Helen Keller International, the ACLU, and the NAACP. She believed true happiness came from helping and working in partnership with others, aligning oneself with a higher purpose, and from within oneself.</p><p>\u201cWhen one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us,\u201d she <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/We-Bereaved-Helen-Keller/dp/B002JHIQ9O\\\">wrote</a> in 1929.

In fact, when we think of the most recited lines in literature, many of them have been popularized by their on-screen adaptations: \u201cWinter is coming\u201d from <em>Game of Thrones</em>; \u201cMay the odds be ever in your favor\u201d from <em>The Hunger Games</em>; and \u201cChoose life\u201d from <em>Trainspotting</em>,<em> </em>to name just a few. </p><p>Yet plenty of other famous lines from novels and essays have stood on their own, especially among bookworms.

It\u2019s a potent display of Lewis Carroll\u2019s colorful imagination, as well as an examination of fate, the importance of language, and the trials of growing up.</p><p></p><blockquote>Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.<br><em>\u2014 \u201cThe Picture of Dorian Grey\u201d by Oscar Wilde, 1891</em></blockquote><p>Controversial in its day, Oscar Wilde\u2019s philosophical novel is now regarded as a classic of gothic literature.

I couldn\u2019t do it out of nothing.<br><em>\u2014 Akira Kurosawa</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>If you are interested in making your film your way, you have to have total creative freedom and final cut. Coming from the world of painting, I always say, no one walks into your room and says, \u201cI don\u2019t like that blue. Change it.\u201d It should be that way in film.<br><em>\u2014 David Lynch</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>A hunch is creativity trying to tell you something.<br><em>\u2014 Frank Capra</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Just write three or four pages. It's like chopping a tree. Even if you're John Henry, you're not gonna knock down a tree with one stroke. Keep chopping, and eventually, you'll get to the end.<br><em>\u2014 Spike Lee</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>I\u2019ve always been compelled by the idea that your mind, when you\u2019re asleep, can create a world that it perceives simultaneously: you\u2019ve literally created a world in your dream... That, to me, has always been the most profound demonstration of the infinite potential of the human mind.<br><em>\u2014 Christopher Nolan</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>That's the way I work: I try to imagine what I would like to see.<br><em>\u2014 Sofia Coppola</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>I think doing something creative is the most important thing to me, and I think it's probably just good for the soul for anyone, whatever it is ... I think everyone needs to create something.<br><em>\u2014 Ricky Gervais</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Making movies is a way of understanding myself and the world.<br><em>\u2014 Ang Lee</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>The public has an appetite for anything about imagination \u2014 anything that is as far away from reality as is creatively possible.<br><em>\u2014 Steven Spielberg</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>A film is \u2014 or should be \u2014 more like music than like fiction. It should be a progression of moods and feelings. The theme, what's behind the emotion, the meaning, all that comes later.<br><em>\u2014 Stanley Kubrick</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Normal is not the thing you usually look for when creating an interesting character.<br><em>\u2014 Wes Anderson</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>The first thing I do when I\u2019m trying to come up with a movie is I listen to myself, so listen to my emotion. What makes me scared?<br><em>\u2014 Jordan Peele</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality. Don\u2019t put limitations on yourself. Others will do that for you.<br><em>\u2014 James Cameron</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Nobody knows what you have in you until you've done it, so I just keep pushing those boundaries, and I figure it will all come out in the wash.<br><em>\u2014 Greta Gerwig</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>I pay tribute to the writing always. The writer is a creative artist and the director is an interpretive artist and the actors are interpretive. You take zero and make it into something, that's always amazing to me.<br><em>\u2014 Clint Eastwood</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>The director\u2019s task is to recreate life, its movement, its contradictions, its dynamic and conflicts. It is his duty to reveal every iota of the truth he has seen, even if not everyone finds that truth acceptable.<br><em>\u2014 Andrei Tarkovsky</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>What you have to make secure and guard with your life \u2014 because it is your life \u2014 is the same pure creativity that brought you here, and that brought me here too.<br><em>\u2014 Martin Scorsese</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Creativity is an energy. It's a precious energy, and it's something to be protected. A lot of people take for granted that they're a creative person, but I know from experience, feeling it in myself, it is a magic; it is an energy. And it can't be taken for granted.<br><em>\u2014 Ava DuVernay</em></blockquote><p></p><p>Photo credit: sharegrid/ Unsplash</p>\",\"htmlChunks\":[\"<p>Filmmaking is a collective process, whether it\u2019s a small independent movie involving a handful of people or a Hollywood blockbuster like <em>Avatar</em> or <em>Iron Man 3</em>, which both had <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://stephenfollows.com/how-many-people-work-on-a-hollywood-film/\\\">crews of around 3,000 people</a>.

When Sofia Coppola, for example, signed up to direct <em>Somewhere</em> in 2010, \u00a0<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://thecreativelife.net/the-creative-life-of-sofia-coppola/\\\">she said</a>, \u201cI was trying to make the budget as small as possible so that I can work creatively. Because otherwise, you have to listen to the money people.\u201d</p><p>Creativity is the driving force behind any movie, however large or small the production. Famous filmmakers, therefore, know a thing or two about imagination and vision, as the following quotes reveal.</p><p></p><blockquote>My own experiences and the various things I have read remain in my memory and become the basis upon which I create something new. I couldn\u2019t do it out of nothing.<br><em>\u2014 Akira Kurosawa</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>If you are interested in making your film your way, you have to have total creative freedom and final cut. Coming from the world of painting, I always say, no one walks into your room and says, \u201cI don\u2019t like that blue. Change it.\u201d It should be that way in film.<br><em>\u2014 David Lynch</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>A hunch is creativity trying to tell you something.<br><em>\u2014 Frank Capra</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Just write three or four pages. It's like chopping a tree. Even if you're John Henry, you're not gonna knock down a tree with one stroke. Keep chopping, and eventually, you'll get to the end.<br><em>\u2014 Spike Lee</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>I\u2019ve always been compelled by the idea that your mind, when you\u2019re asleep, can create a world that it perceives simultaneously: you\u2019ve literally created a world in your dream... That, to me, has always been the most profound demonstration of the infinite potential of the human mind.<br><em>\u2014 Christopher Nolan</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>That's the way I work: I try to imagine what I would like to see.<br><em>\u2014 Sofia Coppola</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>I think doing something creative is the most important thing to me, and I think it's probably just good for the soul for anyone, whatever it is ... I think everyone needs to create something.<br><em>\u2014 Ricky Gervais</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Making movies is a way of understanding myself and the world.<br><em>\u2014 Ang Lee</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>The public has an appetite for anything about imagination \u2014 anything that is as far away from reality as is creatively possible.<br><em>\u2014 Steven Spielberg</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>A film is \u2014 or should be \u2014 more like music than like fiction. It should be a progression of moods and feelings. The theme, what's behind the emotion, the meaning, all that comes later.<br><em>\u2014 Stanley Kubrick</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Normal is not the thing you usually look for when creating an interesting character.<br><em>\u2014 Wes Anderson</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>The first thing I do when I\u2019m trying to come up with a movie is I listen to myself, so listen to my emotion. What makes me scared?<br><em>\u2014 Jordan Peele</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality. Don\u2019t put limitations on yourself. Others will do that for you.<br><em>\u2014 James Cameron</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Nobody knows what you have in you until you've done it, so I just keep pushing those boundaries, and I figure it will all come out in the wash.<br><em>\u2014 Greta Gerwig</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>I pay tribute to the writing always. The writer is a creative artist and the director is an interpretive artist and the actors are interpretive. You take zero and make it into something, that's always amazing to me.<br><em>\u2014 Clint Eastwood</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>The director\u2019s task is to recreate life, its movement, its contradictions, its dynamic and conflicts. It is his duty to reveal every iota of the truth he has seen, even if not everyone finds that truth acceptable.<br><em>\u2014 Andrei Tarkovsky</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>What you have to make secure and guard with your life \u2014 because it is your life \u2014 is the same pure creativity that brought you here, and that brought me here too.<br><em>\u2014 Martin Scorsese</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Creativity is an energy. It's a precious energy, and it's something to be protected. A lot of people take for granted that they're a creative person, but I know from experience, feeling it in myself, it is a magic; it is an energy. And it can't be taken for granted.<br><em>\u2014 Ava DuVernay</em></blockquote><p></p><p>Photo credit: sharegrid/ Unsplash</p>\"],\"excerpt\":\"From Spielberg to Coppola, these filmmakers know a thing or two about imagination and vision.\",\"imageUrl\":\"https://imgblog.inspiringquotes.com/2021/09/filmakers--1-.jpg\",\"featured\":false,\"tags\":[{\"_id\":\"60536eceb411db0006940f87\",\"slug\":\"entertainment\",\"name\":\"entertainment\",\"visible\":true,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"url\":\"/tag/entertainment\"},{\"_id\":\"602c5832012afd0006cfdee9\",\"slug\":\"creativity\",\"name\":\"creativity\",\"visible\":true,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":false,\"url\":\"/tag/creativity\"},{\"_id\":\"602c5832012afd0006cfdee8\",\"slug\":\"motivation\",\"name\":\"motivation\",\"visible\":true,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":false,\"url\":\"/tag/motivation\"}],\"authors\":[{\"_id\":\"603852eab411db0006940a88\",\"name\":\"Tony Dunnell\",\"slug\":\"tony\",\"url\":\"http://editorial.inspiringquotes.com/author/tony/\",\"profileImageUrl\":\"https://imgblog.inspiringquotes.com/2021/02/profile-pic.jpg\",\"coverImageUrl\":null,\"location\":null,\"bio\":\"Tony is an English writer of non-fiction and fiction living on the edge of the Amazon jungle.\",\"website\":null,\"facebookUser\":null,\"twitterUser\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"articlesCount\":null}],\"primaryAuthor\":{\"_id\":\"603852eab411db0006940a88\",\"name\":\"Tony Dunnell\",\"slug\":\"tony\",\"url\":\"http://editorial.inspiringquotes.com/author/tony/\",\"profileImageUrl\":\"https://imgblog.inspiringquotes.com/2021/02/profile-pic.jpg\",\"coverImageUrl\":null,\"location\":null,\"bio\":\"Tony is an English writer of non-fiction and fiction living on the edge of the Amazon jungle.\",\"website\":null,\"facebookUser\":null,\"twitterUser\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"articlesCount\":null},\"primaryTag\":{\"_id\":\"60536eceb411db0006940f87\",\"slug\":\"entertainment\",\"name\":\"entertainment\",\"visible\":true,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"url\":\"/tag/entertainment\"},\"readingTime\":3,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":\"Creativity is the driving force behind any movie, and filmmakers know a thing or two about imagination and vision.\",\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":\"Creativity is the driving force behind any movie, and filmmakers know a thing or two about imagination and vision.\",\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":\"Creativity is the driving force behind any movie, and filmmakers know a thing or two about imagination and vision.\",\"imageUrl\":null}},\"publishedTs\":\"2021-09-29T17:50:01.000Z\",\"contentTags\":[],\"entityURL\":\"/18-famous-filmmakers-on-creativity/YVSmSDTAMwAGYi4g\"}],\"entityURL\":\"/inspiration/645124e010b7b30008ea9d8c\"},{\"_id\":\"63eba5ab8b44580008261f21\",\"_version\":1,\"activeTs\":\"2023-02-25T08:00:00.000Z\",\"createdTs\":\"2023-02-14T15:15:55.550Z\",\"updatedTs\":\"2023-02-14T15:23:52.119Z\",\"hidden\":false,\"contentIndex\":null,\"title\":\"Today's quote from Carl Jung\",\"quoteId\":\"63e6e5fd9f5f6800084c25c5\",\"dailyInspirationId\":\"63eba31f3eced5000a66be99\",\"questionId\":\"60ee5277dafa7800075a3883\",\"articleIds\":[\"6397cf71e8360a0008ea950d\",\"62fbd6626956990007328161\"],\"bookId\":null,\"book\":null,\"dailyInspiration\":{\"_id\":\"63eba31f3eced5000a66be99\",\"_version\":1,\"activeTs\":null,\"createdTs\":\"2023-02-14T15:05:03.948Z\",\"updatedTs\":\"2023-02-14T15:05:03.948Z\",\"hidden\":false,\"title\":\"Carl Jung - the shoe - 2/23\",\"description\":\"<p>The son of a pastor, with clergy on both sides of his family, Carl Jung seemed destined to become a minister \u2014 until, in his teens, he began studying philosophy.

But Proust largely let his magnum opus do the talking for him, safe in the knowledge that everything, be it folly or not, was at the whim of time and memory.

Siblings can help us understand ourselves better, too. </p><p>As we develop our likes and dislikes when we\u2019re young, we often base our preferences on what we observe in our siblings \u2014 they give us a steady point of comparison from which to form our own identity. Later in life, having a sibling to confide in is truly priceless, given their decades-long understanding of our life circumstances and upbringing. So whether you and your sibling are attached at the hip or the quintessential rivals, here are 13 quotes to remind you of the lasting value of this singular, special relationship.</p><p></p><blockquote>Children of the same family, the same blood, with the same first associations and habits, have some means of enjoyment in their power, which no subsequent connections can supply.<br><em>\u2014 Jane Austen</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>A sibling is the lens through which you see your childhood.<br><em>\u2014 Ann Hood, author</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Siblings: children of the same parents, each of whom is perfectly normal until they get together.<br><em>\u2014 Sam Levenson, humorist</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>A sibling may be the sole keeper of one\u2019s core identity, the only person with the keys to one\u2019s unfettered, more fundamental self.<br><em>\u2014 Marian Sandmaier, author</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>What causes sibling rivalry? Having more than one kid.<br><em>\u2014 Tim Allen</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>I do find the sibling connection endlessly fascinating, as I do all family dynamics. I like how siblings seem to create their own parentless mini-civilization within a family, one that has its own laws, myths, language, humor, its own loyalties and treacheries.<br><em>\u2014 Jandy Nelson, author</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>The advantage of growing up with siblings is that you become very good at fractions.<br><em>\u2014 Robert Brault, author</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Having lots of siblings is like having built-in best friends.<br><em>\u2014 Kim Kardashian</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Siblings that say they never fight are most definitely hiding something.<br><em>\u2014 Lemony Snicket (Daniel Handler)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>To the outside world, we all grow old. But not to brothers and sisters. We know each other as we always were, we know each other\u2019s hearts, we share private family jokes. We remember family feuds and secrets, family griefs and joys.<br><em>\u2014 Clara Ortega, author</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>It was wonderful to grow up with so many siblings. We were all just a year or two apart, and we were always so supportive of each other.<br><em>\u2014 Joaquin Phoenix</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>If you want to do really important things in life and big things in life, you can\u2019t do anything by yourself. And your best teams are your friends and your siblings.<br><em>\u2014 Deepak Chopra</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Siblings are a volume of childhood memories; a nostalgia that cannot be easily deleted.<br><em>\u2015 Vincent Okay Nwachukwu, filmmaker</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Is solace anywhere more comforting than in the arms of a sister?<br><em>\u2013 Alice Walker</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>A sister is both your mirror \u2014 and your opposite.<br><em>\u2013 Elizabeth Fishel, journalist and author</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Brothers don\u2019t necessarily have to say anything to each other \u2014 they can sit in a room and be together and just be completely comfortable with each other.<br><em>\u2013 Leonardo DiCaprio</em></blockquote><p></p><p>Photo credit: ljubaphoto/ iStock</p>\"],\"excerpt\":\"Whether you consider them your ride-or-dies or the thorns in your side, siblings often know you in ways no one else can.\",\"imageUrl\":\"https://imgblog.inspiringquotes.com/2022/11/IQ-Articles-Sibling-Bonds.jpg\",\"featured\":false,\"tags\":[{\"_id\":\"60259447012afd0006cfde2b\",\"slug\":\"love\",\"name\":\"love\",\"visible\":true,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"url\":\"/tag/love\"},{\"_id\":\"60ca41017f8d820007ad4286\",\"slug\":\"family\",\"name\":\"family\",\"visible\":true,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":false,\"url\":\"/tag/family\"}],\"authors\":[{\"_id\":\"603857d6b411db0006940ab6\",\"name\":\"Joyce Chen\",\"slug\":\"joyce\",\"url\":\"http://editorial.inspiringquotes.com/author/joyce/\",\"profileImageUrl\":\"https://imgblog.inspiringquotes.com/2021/02/J.Chen-headshot.jpg\",\"coverImageUrl\":null,\"location\":null,\"bio\":\"Joyce Chen is a writer, editor, and community builder based in Seattle, Washington.\\n\",\"website\":null,\"facebookUser\":null,\"twitterUser\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"articlesCount\":null}],\"primaryAuthor\":{\"_id\":\"603857d6b411db0006940ab6\",\"name\":\"Joyce Chen\",\"slug\":\"joyce\",\"url\":\"http://editorial.inspiringquotes.com/author/joyce/\",\"profileImageUrl\":\"https://imgblog.inspiringquotes.com/2021/02/J.Chen-headshot.jpg\",\"coverImageUrl\":null,\"location\":null,\"bio\":\"Joyce Chen is a writer, editor, and community builder based in Seattle, Washington.\\n\",\"website\":null,\"facebookUser\":null,\"twitterUser\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"articlesCount\":null},\"primaryTag\":{\"_id\":\"60259447012afd0006cfde2b\",\"slug\":\"love\",\"name\":\"love\",\"visible\":true,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"url\":\"/tag/love\"},\"readingTime\":2,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":\"Whether you consider them your ride-or-dies or the thorns in your side, siblings often know you in ways no one else can.\",\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":\"Whether you consider them your ride-or-dies or the thorns in your side, siblings often know you in ways no one else can.\",\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":\"Whether you consider them your ride-or-dies or the thorns in your side, siblings often know you in ways no one else can.\",\"imageUrl\":null}},\"publishedTs\":\"2022-11-22T14:32:19.000Z\",\"contentTags\":[],\"entityURL\":\"/17-quotes-about-the-bond-between-siblings/Y3wYmh5NpAAIKq1d\"},{\"_id\":\"638ea288e8360a0008ea92d6\",\"_version\":1,\"activeTs\":\"2022-12-06T02:06:09.000Z\",\"createdTs\":\"2022-12-06T02:01:44.000Z\",\"updatedTs\":\"2022-12-06T02:06:09.000Z\",\"hidden\":false,\"title\":\"18 Motivating Quotes for Anyone Learning a New Skill\",\"slug\":\"18-motivating-quotes-for-anyone-learning-a-new-skill\",\"html\":\"<p>To live is to learn, whether it\u2019s a new language, instrument, sport, or career skill.

Whether we\u2019re seeking a redo of our own actions or giving a loved one another chance, starting over is often deeply intertwined with strong emotions that make the potential for forgiveness and perseverance more complex. </p><p>Yet second chances are by nature hopeful, usually granted on the presumption that past mistakes can educate us on how to head into a brighter future. Under the right circumstances and with a bit of self-introspection, an opportunity to start anew can produce relationships that are stronger than ever before, and accomplishments we could never have achieved without learning from the past. Here are 20 modicums of wisdom to keep in mind about the benefits of giving it another go.</p><p></p><blockquote>This is what life is about.

A thing is not necessarily either true or false; it can be both true and false.\u201d </p><p>The postmodern worldview denies any single truth, be it moral, historical, or otherwise \u2014 a controversial idea, especially in what many see as our \u201cpost-truth\u201d age. Objective reality is very much in question when it comes to postmodernism. \u201cDon\u2019t be real, be postmodern,\u201d sang the Scottish rock band Idlewild in \u201c<a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U573b653Sg\\\">These Wooden Ideas</a>,\u201d a song <a href=\\\"https://songmeanings.com/songs/view/62230/\\\">whose lyrics</a> criticize postmodern culture and philosophy. Or as Filipino writer Miguel Syjuco put it <a href=\\\"https://archive.nytimes.com/artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/08/reviewer-spotlight-miguel-syjuco/?src=tp\\\">when asked about postmodernism</a>, \u201cWhere modernism was about objectivity, postmodernism was about subjectivity. Where modernism sought a singular truth, postmodernism sought the multiplicity of truths.\u201d </p><h2 id=\\\"skepticism-in-all\\\">Skepticism in all<br></h2><p>Tied in with the rejection of hard truths is the postmodernists\u2019 overall skepticism. In <em>The Postmodern Condition</em> (1979), the French philosopher Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard famously wrote, \u201cSimplifying to the extreme, I define postmodern as incredulity toward metanarratives\u201d \u2014 metanarratives here referring to any unified, universal story about everything that is. In postmodernism, there is an overarching mistrust of these narratives, including such things as science, human progress, and the Enlightenment. Some might call this pessimistic. The historian Robert Hewison <a href=\\\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-05-12-op-3262-story.html\\\">said</a>, \u201cPostmodernism is modernism with the optimism taken out.\u201d </p><h2 id=\\\"undefined-artistic-style\\\">Undefined artistic style<br></h2><p>One of the reasons why postmodernism is hard to define is its lack of a defined style in artistic terms. As the <a href=\\\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/p/postmodernism\\\">Tate Museum website points out</a>, postmodernism is anti-authoritarian by nature, refusing \u201cto recognize the authority of any single style or definition of what art should be.\u201d </p><p>Instead, postmodern art \u2014 whether in painting, cinema, architecture, or otherwise \u2014 tends to blur the divide between high and low art, and often refuses to follow any typical notions of gender, race, genre, and even time. It also tends to reject the very notion of progress in art, including concepts of authenticity and originality \u2014 something that led the art critic Irving Sandler <a href=\\\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/scene-it-all/\\\">to say</a>, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible in our postmodern era for anyone to be original \u2014 for anybody to do what Jackson Pollock did.\u201d </p><h2 id=\\\"culture-of-fragmentation\\\">Culture of fragmentation <br></h2><p>Fragmentation is a trait of postmodernism, especially in literature. Postmodern writers (in their skepticism) distrust the wholeness and conclusiveness associated with traditional stories. They therefore seek alternative ways of structuring their narratives. A prime example of this is <em>The French Lieutenant\u2019s Woman</em>, a historical fiction novel by John Fowles in which the reader is given three possible endings. </p><p>The fragmentation, or disintegration, inherent in postmodernism is also highlighted by <em>The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms</em>, which, <a href=\\\"https://books.google.com.pe/books?id=N7S6BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA288&amp;lpg=PA288&amp;dq=Jean+Baudrillard+Postmodernity+is+said+to+be+a+culture+of+fragmentary+sensations,+eclectic+nostalgia,+disposable+simulacra,+and+promiscuous+superficiality,+in+which+the+traditionally+valued+qualities+of+depth,+coherence,+meaning,+originality,+and+authenticity+are+evacuated+or+dissolved+amid+the+random+swirl+of+empty+signals.%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Af9SY2-328&amp;sig=ACfU3U3VmuaSRjdoRFwUtZw3csqzTVT50g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjV87Hvy4v8AhWmpZUCHa2_C304ChDoAXoECAMQAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Jean%20Baudrillard%20Postmodernity%20is%20said%20to%20be%20a%20culture%20of%20fragmentary%20sensations%2C%20eclectic%20nostalgia%2C%20disposable%20simulacra%2C%20and%20promiscuous%20superficiality%2C%20in%20which%20the%20traditionally%20valued%20qualities%20of%20depth%2C%20coherence%2C%20meaning%2C%20originality%2C%20and%20authenticity%20are%20evacuated%20or%20dissolved%20amid%20the%20random%20swirl%20of%20empty%20signals.%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false\\\">citing the philosopher Jean Baudrillard</a>, states, \u201cPostmodernity is said to be a culture of fragmentary sensations\u2026 \u00a0in which the traditionally valued qualities of depth, coherence, meaning, originality, and authenticity are evacuated or dissolved amid the random swirl of empty signals.\u201d</p><h2 id=\\\"the-death-of-postmodernism\\\">The death of postmodernism?<br></h2><p>In 1992, the Scottish novelist Gilbert Adair <a href=\\\"https://books.google.com.pe/books?id=v9BgLE_WfsMC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=Postmodernism+represents+a+moment+of+suspension+before+the+batteries+are+recharged+for+the+new+millennium,+an+acknowledgment+that+preceding+the+future+is+a+strange+and+hybrid+interregnum+that+might+be+called+the+last+gasp+of+the+past.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IglEleFOjJ&amp;sig=ACfU3U39Z_mswGfi_JwVhZydb0ExrYCYTw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiGgKi9z438AhVBpZUCHRbxDAgQ6AF6BAgeEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Postmodernism%20represents%20a%20moment%20of%20suspension%20before%20the%20batteries%20are%20recharged%20for%20the%20new%20millennium%2C%20an%20acknowledgment%20that%20preceding%20the%20future%20is%20a%20strange%20and%20hybrid%20interregnum%20that%20might%20be%20called%20the%20last%20gasp%20of%20the%20past.&amp;f=false\\\">wrote that</a> postmodernism \u201crepresents a moment of suspension before the batteries are recharged for the new millennium, an acknowledgment that preceding the future is a strange and hybrid interregnum that might be called the last gasp of the past.\u201d </p><p>In other words, postmodernism must eventually die \u2014 and maybe it already has. In 2006, the British cultural critic Alan Kirby published his essay <em>The Death of Postmodernism and Beyond</em>, in which he argued that postmodernism as a cultural period is over. He pulled no punches, writing that \u201cthe only place where the postmodern is extant is in children\u2019s cartoons like <em>Shrek</em> and <em>The Incredibles</em>\u2026 a source of marginal gags in pop culture aimed at the under-eights.\u201d And Kirby is not alone in his opinion that postmodernism is no more. </p><p>So what next? Well, \u201cpost-postmodernism\u201d is now a buzzword, at least in academic circles. Kirby himself has suggested pseudomodernism and digimodernism as a new paradigm, taking into account the inexorable rise of digital technology. So, the rabbit is already digging a new hole \u2014 but where it will go, we don\u2019t yet know. </p><p></p><p>Photo credit: Evening Standard/ Hulton Archive via Getty Images</p>\",\"htmlChunks\":[\"<p>Postmodernism sounds simple, right?

A thing is not necessarily either true or false; it can be both true and false.\u201d </p><p>The postmodern worldview denies any single truth, be it moral, historical, or otherwise \u2014 a controversial idea, especially in what many see as our \u201cpost-truth\u201d age. Objective reality is very much in question when it comes to postmodernism. \u201cDon\u2019t be real, be postmodern,\u201d sang the Scottish rock band Idlewild in \u201c<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U573b653Sg\\\">These Wooden Ideas</a>,\u201d a song <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://songmeanings.com/songs/view/62230/\\\">whose lyrics</a> criticize postmodern culture and philosophy. Or as Filipino writer Miguel Syjuco put it <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://archive.nytimes.com/artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/08/reviewer-spotlight-miguel-syjuco/?src=tp\\\">when asked about postmodernism</a>, \u201cWhere modernism was about objectivity, postmodernism was about subjectivity. Where modernism sought a singular truth, postmodernism sought the multiplicity of truths.\u201d </p>\",\"<h2 id=\\\"skepticism-in-all\\\">Skepticism in all<br></h2><p>Tied in with the rejection of hard truths is the postmodernists\u2019 overall skepticism. In <em>The Postmodern Condition</em> (1979), the French philosopher Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard famously wrote, \u201cSimplifying to the extreme, I define postmodern as incredulity toward metanarratives\u201d \u2014 metanarratives here referring to any unified, universal story about everything that is. In postmodernism, there is an overarching mistrust of these narratives, including such things as science, human progress, and the Enlightenment. Some might call this pessimistic. The historian Robert Hewison <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-05-12-op-3262-story.html\\\">said</a>, \u201cPostmodernism is modernism with the optimism taken out.\u201d </p>\",\"<h2 id=\\\"undefined-artistic-style\\\">Undefined artistic style<br></h2><p>One of the reasons why postmodernism is hard to define is its lack of a defined style in artistic terms. As the <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/p/postmodernism\\\">Tate Museum website points out</a>, postmodernism is anti-authoritarian by nature, refusing \u201cto recognize the authority of any single style or definition of what art should be.\u201d </p><p>Instead, postmodern art \u2014 whether in painting, cinema, architecture, or otherwise \u2014 tends to blur the divide between high and low art, and often refuses to follow any typical notions of gender, race, genre, and even time. It also tends to reject the very notion of progress in art, including concepts of authenticity and originality \u2014 something that led the art critic Irving Sandler <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/scene-it-all/\\\">to say</a>, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible in our postmodern era for anyone to be original \u2014 for anybody to do what Jackson Pollock did.\u201d </p>\",\"<h2 id=\\\"culture-of-fragmentation\\\">Culture of fragmentation <br></h2><p>Fragmentation is a trait of postmodernism, especially in literature. Postmodern writers (in their skepticism) distrust the wholeness and conclusiveness associated with traditional stories. They therefore seek alternative ways of structuring their narratives. A prime example of this is <em>The French Lieutenant\u2019s Woman</em>, a historical fiction novel by John Fowles in which the reader is given three possible endings. </p><p>The fragmentation, or disintegration, inherent in postmodernism is also highlighted by <em>The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms</em>, which, <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://books.google.com.pe/books?id=N7S6BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA288&amp;lpg=PA288&amp;dq=Jean+Baudrillard+Postmodernity+is+said+to+be+a+culture+of+fragmentary+sensations,+eclectic+nostalgia,+disposable+simulacra,+and+promiscuous+superficiality,+in+which+the+traditionally+valued+qualities+of+depth,+coherence,+meaning,+originality,+and+authenticity+are+evacuated+or+dissolved+amid+the+random+swirl+of+empty+signals.%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Af9SY2-328&amp;sig=ACfU3U3VmuaSRjdoRFwUtZw3csqzTVT50g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjV87Hvy4v8AhWmpZUCHa2_C304ChDoAXoECAMQAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Jean%20Baudrillard%20Postmodernity%20is%20said%20to%20be%20a%20culture%20of%20fragmentary%20sensations%2C%20eclectic%20nostalgia%2C%20disposable%20simulacra%2C%20and%20promiscuous%20superficiality%2C%20in%20which%20the%20traditionally%20valued%20qualities%20of%20depth%2C%20coherence%2C%20meaning%2C%20originality%2C%20and%20authenticity%20are%20evacuated%20or%20dissolved%20amid%20the%20random%20swirl%20of%20empty%20signals.%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false\\\">citing the philosopher Jean Baudrillard</a>, states, \u201cPostmodernity is said to be a culture of fragmentary sensations\u2026 \u00a0in which the traditionally valued qualities of depth, coherence, meaning, originality, and authenticity are evacuated or dissolved amid the random swirl of empty signals.\u201d</p>\",\"<h2 id=\\\"the-death-of-postmodernism\\\">The death of postmodernism?<br></h2><p>In 1992, the Scottish novelist Gilbert Adair <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://books.google.com.pe/books?id=v9BgLE_WfsMC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=Postmodernism+represents+a+moment+of+suspension+before+the+batteries+are+recharged+for+the+new+millennium,+an+acknowledgment+that+preceding+the+future+is+a+strange+and+hybrid+interregnum+that+might+be+called+the+last+gasp+of+the+past.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IglEleFOjJ&amp;sig=ACfU3U39Z_mswGfi_JwVhZydb0ExrYCYTw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiGgKi9z438AhVBpZUCHRbxDAgQ6AF6BAgeEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Postmodernism%20represents%20a%20moment%20of%20suspension%20before%20the%20batteries%20are%20recharged%20for%20the%20new%20millennium%2C%20an%20acknowledgment%20that%20preceding%20the%20future%20is%20a%20strange%20and%20hybrid%20interregnum%20that%20might%20be%20called%20the%20last%20gasp%20of%20the%20past.&amp;f=false\\\">wrote that</a> postmodernism \u201crepresents a moment of suspension before the batteries are recharged for the new millennium, an acknowledgment that preceding the future is a strange and hybrid interregnum that might be called the last gasp of the past.\u201d </p><p>In other words, postmodernism must eventually die \u2014 and maybe it already has. In 2006, the British cultural critic Alan Kirby published his essay <em>The Death of Postmodernism and Beyond</em>, in which he argued that postmodernism as a cultural period is over. He pulled no punches, writing that \u201cthe only place where the postmodern is extant is in children\u2019s cartoons like <em>Shrek</em> and <em>The Incredibles</em>\u2026 a source of marginal gags in pop culture aimed at the under-eights.\u201d And Kirby is not alone in his opinion that postmodernism is no more. </p><p>So what next? Well, \u201cpost-postmodernism\u201d is now a buzzword, at least in academic circles. Kirby himself has suggested pseudomodernism and digimodernism as a new paradigm, taking into account the inexorable rise of digital technology. So, the rabbit is already digging a new hole \u2014 but where it will go, we don\u2019t yet know. </p><p></p><p>Photo credit: Evening Standard/ Hulton Archive via Getty Images</p>\"],\"excerpt\":\"Postmodernism emphasizes the elusiveness of meaning and knowledge \u2014\u00a0and is by its very nature a difficult concept to pin down. \",\"imageUrl\":\"https://imgblog.inspiringquotes.com/2023/01/IQ-article_postmodernism.jpg\",\"featured\":false,\"tags\":[{\"_id\":\"603e7b8cb411db0006940bd3\",\"slug\":\"philosophy\",\"name\":\"philosophy\",\"visible\":true,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"url\":\"/tag/philosophy\"}],\"authors\":[{\"_id\":\"603852eab411db0006940a88\",\"name\":\"Tony Dunnell\",\"slug\":\"tony\",\"url\":\"http://editorial.inspiringquotes.com/author/tony/\",\"profileImageUrl\":\"https://imgblog.inspiringquotes.com/2021/02/profile-pic.jpg\",\"coverImageUrl\":null,\"location\":null,\"bio\":\"Tony is an English writer of non-fiction and fiction living on the edge of the Amazon jungle.\",\"website\":null,\"facebookUser\":null,\"twitterUser\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"articlesCount\":null}],\"primaryAuthor\":{\"_id\":\"603852eab411db0006940a88\",\"name\":\"Tony Dunnell\",\"slug\":\"tony\",\"url\":\"http://editorial.inspiringquotes.com/author/tony/\",\"profileImageUrl\":\"https://imgblog.inspiringquotes.com/2021/02/profile-pic.jpg\",\"coverImageUrl\":null,\"location\":null,\"bio\":\"Tony is an English writer of non-fiction and fiction living on the edge of the Amazon jungle.\",\"website\":null,\"facebookUser\":null,\"twitterUser\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"articlesCount\":null},\"primaryTag\":{\"_id\":\"603e7b8cb411db0006940bd3\",\"slug\":\"philosophy\",\"name\":\"philosophy\",\"visible\":true,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"url\":\"/tag/philosophy\"},\"readingTime\":4,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":\"Postmodernism emphasizes the elusiveness of meaning and knowledge \u2014\u00a0and is by its very nature a difficult concept to pin down. \",\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":\"Postmodernism emphasizes the elusiveness of meaning and knowledge \u2014\u00a0and is by its very nature a difficult concept to pin down. \",\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":\"Postmodernism emphasizes the elusiveness of meaning and knowledge \u2014\u00a0and is by its very nature a difficult concept to pin down. \",\"imageUrl\":null}},\"publishedTs\":\"2023-01-30T23:28:43.000Z\",\"contentTags\":[],\"entityURL\":\"/what-is-postmodernism/Y9hR11h0GwAJZgn0\"},{\"_id\":\"62f6c4016956990007328142\",\"_version\":1,\"activeTs\":\"2022-08-12T21:24:46.000Z\",\"createdTs\":\"2022-08-12T21:20:01.000Z\",\"updatedTs\":\"2022-08-12T21:24:46.000Z\",\"hidden\":false,\"title\":\"14 Quotes From the Best Teachers on TV\",\"slug\":\"14-quotes-from-the-best-teachers-on-tv\",\"html\":\"<p>They inspire us.

She reflects that courage brings joy, that the willingness to push boundaries is the cost of admission to a fulfilling and vibrant life. It is no small price to pay, because bravery can only exist where there is also fear.

From her early days as a child actress in the 1940s, through her silver-screen domination during the 1950s, to becoming the highest-paid movie star in the \u201960s, the violet-eyed legend remained a famous figure until her death in 2011 at age 79.</p><p>But Taylor\u2019s life wasn\u2019t always as charmed as her glamorous image seemed to portray. She endured numerous health issues throughout her adulthood, was the subject of scandals in the public eye, and suffered great personal tragedy. Through it all, Taylor remained resilient. She challenged Hollywood standards, demonstrated savvy business smarts, and became an unlikely advocate for causes that were ahead of their time. She was a force to reckon with, and her spirit has made her an inspiration to generations of fans.</p><p></p><h2 id=\\\"she-was-a-trailblazer\\\">She was a trailblazer</h2><p></p><blockquote>I've always admitted that I'm ruled by my passions.</blockquote><p>When Taylor was just 15 years old, the newly minted young starlet did something that even many seasoned actors wouldn\u2019t dream of: She yelled at a studio executive. When MGM head honcho Louis B. Mayer swore at Taylor\u2019s mother, who had accompanied her on set, the young actress told him to \u201cgo straight to hell!\u201d \u2014 and refused to apologize.</p><p>Taylor didn\u2019t stop upending the staid Hollywood norm there. For her Oscar-winning role as Martha in 1966\u2019s Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, the star defied her status as one of the most beautiful women in the world to create a stunning character. She gained 30 pounds, wore appearance-altering makeup, and embodied a raw and real honesty that, while common in prestige films today, was a shock to the industry at the time.</p><p></p><h2 id=\\\"she-had-business-savvy\\\">She had business savvy</h2><p></p><blockquote>There\u2019s no deodorant like success.</blockquote><p>In 1963, Taylor became the first actor to be paid $1 million for a single role when she starred in the epic film Cleopatra. It was a shrewd negotiating move by a star who knew her worth and her power \u2014 she also negotiated 10% of the film\u2019s profits.</p><p>Beyond her Hollywood career, which she had all but left behind by the late 1970s, Taylor got busy building a business empire. She invested in land, art, and jewels before their prices skyrocketed in their own bubbles. And most notably, she all but invented the celebrity fragrance landscape, licensing her name and image through Elizabeth Arden to create the classic White Diamonds perfume in 1991.</p><p></p><h2 id=\\\"she-was-resilient\\\">She was resilient</h2><p></p><blockquote>You find out who your real friends are when you're involved in a scandal.</blockquote><p>Through the years, Taylor persevered through more than just the limits of the old-fashioned film industry. Her personal life \u2014 especially her eight marriages (including two to the same man, actor Richard Burton, and one to actor Eddie Fisher, which was the result of a scandalous affair) \u2014 garnered endless scrutiny.</p><p>Taylor\u2019s life saw many struggles and setbacks, all of which played out on the public stage. She suffered a tragic loss with the death of her third husband, Mike Todd. Shealso dealt with lifelong health challenges, including scoliosis and subsequent chronic back pain. And she eventually entered a treatment facility to address substance use issues \u2014 which led to her becoming one of the first A-list celebrities to speak openly about addiction and treatment.</p><p></p><h2 id=\\\"she-was-an-early-activist\\\">She was an early activist</h2><p></p><blockquote>I will remain here, as rowdy an activist as I have to be, and, God willing, for as long as I have to be.</blockquote><p>Taylor left an indelible mark on the silver screen, but her legacy is as much in activism as acting. Starting in the mid-1980s, she became an outspoken advocate for the injustice surrounding the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In 1991, she even used the $1 million she earned from the sale of photos from her wedding to her eighth and last husband, Larry Fortensky, to start the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation.</p><p>This was a time when the epidemic was still mired in misinformation and surrounded by fear and discrimination. But Taylor stood firm in her support for the LGBTQ+ communities, channeling the same self-assured fearlessness she showed all those years ago in speaking out against the dominant powers in Hollywood. In 1993, she received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award at the Academy Awards for her efforts. Today, Taylor\u2019s children and grandchildren carry on her philanthropic work through her organization, keeping her name and her inspiring legacy alive.</p><p></p><p>Photo credit: Keystone Features/ Hulton Archive via Getty Images</p>\",\"htmlChunks\":[\"<p>Elizabeth Taylor is an icon of Hollywood\u2019s golden age, and one of the most popular movie stars of all time.

Mayer swore at Taylor\u2019s mother, who had accompanied her on set, the young actress told him to \u201cgo straight to hell!\u201d \u2014 and refused to apologize.</p><p>Taylor didn\u2019t stop upending the staid Hollywood norm there. For her Oscar-winning role as Martha in 1966\u2019s Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, the star defied her status as one of the most beautiful women in the world to create a stunning character. She gained 30 pounds, wore appearance-altering makeup, and embodied a raw and real honesty that, while common in prestige films today, was a shock to the industry at the time.</p><p></p>\",\"<h2 id=\\\"she-had-business-savvy\\\">She had business savvy</h2><p></p><blockquote>There\u2019s no deodorant like success.</blockquote><p>In 1963, Taylor became the first actor to be paid $1 million for a single role when she starred in the epic film Cleopatra. It was a shrewd negotiating move by a star who knew her worth and her power \u2014 she also negotiated 10% of the film\u2019s profits.</p><p>Beyond her Hollywood career, which she had all but left behind by the late 1970s, Taylor got busy building a business empire. She invested in land, art, and jewels before their prices skyrocketed in their own bubbles. And most notably, she all but invented the celebrity fragrance landscape, licensing her name and image through Elizabeth Arden to create the classic White Diamonds perfume in 1991.</p><p></p>\",\"<h2 id=\\\"she-was-resilient\\\">She was resilient</h2><p></p><blockquote>You find out who your real friends are when you're involved in a scandal.</blockquote><p>Through the years, Taylor persevered through more than just the limits of the old-fashioned film industry. Her personal life \u2014 especially her eight marriages (including two to the same man, actor Richard Burton, and one to actor Eddie Fisher, which was the result of a scandalous affair) \u2014 garnered endless scrutiny.</p><p>Taylor\u2019s life saw many struggles and setbacks, all of which played out on the public stage. She suffered a tragic loss with the death of her third husband, Mike Todd. Shealso dealt with lifelong health challenges, including scoliosis and subsequent chronic back pain. And she eventually entered a treatment facility to address substance use issues \u2014 which led to her becoming one of the first A-list celebrities to speak openly about addiction and treatment.</p><p></p>\",\"<h2 id=\\\"she-was-an-early-activist\\\">She was an early activist</h2><p></p><blockquote>I will remain here, as rowdy an activist as I have to be, and, God willing, for as long as I have to be.</blockquote><p>Taylor left an indelible mark on the silver screen, but her legacy is as much in activism as acting. Starting in the mid-1980s, she became an outspoken advocate for the injustice surrounding the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In 1991, she even used the $1 million she earned from the sale of photos from her wedding to her eighth and last husband, Larry Fortensky, to start the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation.</p><p>This was a time when the epidemic was still mired in misinformation and surrounded by fear and discrimination. But Taylor stood firm in her support for the LGBTQ+ communities, channeling the same self-assured fearlessness she showed all those years ago in speaking out against the dominant powers in Hollywood. In 1993, she received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award at the Academy Awards for her efforts. Today, Taylor\u2019s children and grandchildren carry on her philanthropic work through her organization, keeping her name and her inspiring legacy alive.</p><p></p><p>Photo credit: Keystone Features/ Hulton Archive via Getty Images</p>\"],\"excerpt\":\"The star's life wasn\u2019t always as charmed as her glamorous image seemed to portray.\",\"imageUrl\":\"https://imgblog.inspiringquotes.com/2023/02/IQ-article_Elizabeth_taylor.jpg\",\"featured\":false,\"tags\":[{\"_id\":\"60536eceb411db0006940f87\",\"slug\":\"entertainment\",\"name\":\"entertainment\",\"visible\":true,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"url\":\"/tag/entertainment\"}],\"authors\":[{\"_id\":\"63582802d937230008029073\",\"name\":\"Nicole Villeneuve\",\"slug\":\"nicole\",\"url\":\"http://editorial.inspiringquotes.com/author/nicole/\",\"profileImageUrl\":\"https://imgblog.inspiringquotes.com/2022/10/nicole-3.jpeg\",\"coverImageUrl\":null,\"location\":null,\"bio\":\"Nicole is a writer, thrift store lover, and group-chat meme spammer based in Ontario, Canada.\",\"website\":null,\"facebookUser\":null,\"twitterUser\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"articlesCount\":null}],\"primaryAuthor\":{\"_id\":\"63582802d937230008029073\",\"name\":\"Nicole Villeneuve\",\"slug\":\"nicole\",\"url\":\"http://editorial.inspiringquotes.com/author/nicole/\",\"profileImageUrl\":\"https://imgblog.inspiringquotes.com/2022/10/nicole-3.jpeg\",\"coverImageUrl\":null,\"location\":null,\"bio\":\"Nicole is a writer, thrift store lover, and group-chat meme spammer based in Ontario, Canada.\",\"website\":null,\"facebookUser\":null,\"twitterUser\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"articlesCount\":null},\"primaryTag\":{\"_id\":\"60536eceb411db0006940f87\",\"slug\":\"entertainment\",\"name\":\"entertainment\",\"visible\":true,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"url\":\"/tag/entertainment\"},\"readingTime\":3,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":\"Elizabeth Taylor's life wasn\u2019t always as charmed as her glamorous image seemed to portray.\",\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":\"Elizabeth Taylor's life wasn\u2019t always as charmed as her glamorous image seemed to portray.\",\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":\"Elizabeth Taylor's life wasn\u2019t always as charmed as her glamorous image seemed to portray.\",\"imageUrl\":null}},\"publishedTs\":\"2023-02-28T00:54:35.000Z\",\"contentTags\":[],\"entityURL\":\"/the-inspiring-life-and-legacy-of-elizabeth-taylor/Y_1P2eqLQAAH8FbD\"}],\"entityURL\":\"/inspiration/645c08952f0bfbbff5856605\"},{\"_id\":\"6434325f2eb8320009e43d72\",\"_version\":1,\"activeTs\":\"2023-04-23T07:00:00.000Z\",\"createdTs\":\"2023-04-10T15:59:27.360Z\",\"updatedTs\":\"2023-04-10T17:20:17.233Z\",\"hidden\":false,\"contentIndex\":null,\"title\":\"Eckhart Tolle on what will set you free\",\"quoteId\":\"64342d053ab5310008d37a9f\",\"dailyInspirationId\":\"6434315abd4c5c00093b1c4c\",\"questionId\":\"643436bcbd4c5c00093b324f\",\"articleIds\":[\"63855b621e4da400082aae35\",\"638616fe1e4da400082aaecc\"],\"bookId\":null,\"book\":null,\"question\":{\"_id\":\"643436bcbd4c5c00093b324f\",\"_version\":1,\"activeTs\":\"2023-04-23T07:00:00.000Z\",\"createdTs\":\"2023-04-10T16:18:04.953Z\",\"updatedTs\":\"2023-04-10T16:19:15.880Z\",\"hidden\":false,\"title\":\"Fill in the blank: \\\"Knowing others is intelligence;

Roosevelt</em></blockquote><p>In the early hours of December 7, 1941, the empire of Japan launched an attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The following day, Franklin D. Roosevelt stood before Congress and gave one of the most consequential speeches in U.S. history. The President asked the legislative body to declare war on Japan, marking America\u2019s entry into World War II.</p><h2 id=\\\"abraham-lincoln-s-gettysburg-address-\\\">Abraham Lincoln\u2019s \u201cGettysburg Address\u201d</h2><p></p><blockquote>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.<br><em>\u2014 Abraham Lincoln</em></blockquote><p>When the cannons finally fell silent on July 3, 1863, more than 7,000 Union and Confederate soldiers had lost their lives in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, in one of the most pivotal battles of the American Civil War. Five months later, at what is now Gettysburg National Cemetery, President Abraham Lincoln delivered a 271-word address that became one of the most famous speeches in history, helping to heal the nation while reaffirming its resolve for unity.</p><h2 id=\\\"martin-luther-king-jr-s-i-have-a-dream-speech\\\">Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d Speech</h2><p></p><blockquote>I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.<br><em>\u2014 Martin Luther King Jr.</em></blockquote><p>On August 28, 1963, at the height of the civil rights movement, some 250,000 people gathered for the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

Just a few weeks after his famous resolve to fight at all cost, France surrendered to Germany and a relentless German Luftwaffe air campaign battered the British Isles.

On July 5, 1852, Frederick Douglass, a formerly enslaved person turned social reformer and statesman, delivered this famous speech to the Rochester Ladies' Anti-Slavery Society in Rochester, New York.

Queen Elizabeth I traveled to Tilbury in Essex to speak to the English troops who faced the indomitable Spanish Armada. Elizabeth\u2019s words galvanized the kingdom\u2019s resistance to the invading force.

Today it stands as withering criticism of the hypocrisy of America\u2019s founding.</p>\",\"<h2 id=\\\"harvey-milk-s-hope-speech-\\\">Harvey Milk\u2019s \u201cHope Speech\u201d</h2><p></p><blockquote>The only thing they have to look forward to is hope. And you have to give them hope.<br><em>\u2014 Harvey Milk</em></blockquote><p>One of the first openly gay politicians in the U.S., Harvey Milk fought for LGBTQ+ rights in his hometown of San Francisco and throughout the country. On June 25, 1978, Milk gave his famous \u201cHope\u201d speech on the steps of city hall during a rally for California Gay Freedom Day. The speech \u201cignited the crowd,\u201d according to the San Francisco Examiner, as Milk tied his quest for equality to an indelible message of hope.</p>\",\"<h2 id=\\\"nelson-mandela-s-i-am-prepared-to-die-speech\\\">Nelson Mandela\u2019s \u201cI Am Prepared to Die\u201d Speech</h2><p></p><blockquote>I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.<br><em>\u2014 Nelson Mandela</em></blockquote><p>On April 20, 1964, civil rights leader Nelson Mandela gave a three-hour speech as a defendant on trial. Although Mandela was convicted and imprisoned, the speech confirmed the leader\u2019s unwavering opposition to South Africa\u2019s racist apartheid system, and is now seen as a defining moment for democracy in South Africa and throughout the world.</p>\",\"<h2 id=\\\"elizabeth-i-s-speech-to-the-troops-at-tilbury-\\\">Elizabeth I\u2019s \u201cSpeech to the Troops at Tilbury\u201d</h2><p></p><blockquote>I know I have the body but of a weak, feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of England too.<br><em>\u2014 Elizabeth I</em></blockquote><p>In 1588, England was at war with Spain, whose naval fleet was feared throughout Europe. Queen Elizabeth I traveled to Tilbury in Essex to speak to the English troops who faced the indomitable Spanish Armada. Elizabeth\u2019s words galvanized the kingdom\u2019s resistance to the invading force. The Spanish were eventually defeated by the English, solidifying the island kingdom as a major power, and Elizabeth as its equally powerful monarch.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Photo credit: Reg Lancaster/ Daily Express/ Hulton Archive via Getty Images</p>\"],\"excerpt\":\"Speeches have the power to define a moment or rouse people to action, and some are so powerful they echo through the ages.\",\"imageUrl\":\"https://imgblog.inspiringquotes.com/2022/11/IQ-Articles-Most-Quoted-Speeches.jpg\",\"featured\":false,\"tags\":[{\"_id\":\"603166f1b411db00069409e0\",\"slug\":\"history\",\"name\":\"history\",\"visible\":true,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"url\":\"/tag/history\"}],\"authors\":[{\"_id\":\"61dce47fb73bc100075a787e\",\"name\":\"Darren Orf\",\"slug\":\"darren\",\"url\":\"http://editorial.inspiringquotes.com/author/darren/\",\"profileImageUrl\":\"https://imgblog.inspiringquotes.com/2022/01/download--4-.jpeg\",\"coverImageUrl\":null,\"location\":null,\"bio\":\"Darren lives in Portland, Oregon, has two cats, and writes about science, technology, nature, and history. \",\"website\":null,\"facebookUser\":null,\"twitterUser\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"articlesCount\":null}],\"primaryAuthor\":{\"_id\":\"61dce47fb73bc100075a787e\",\"name\":\"Darren Orf\",\"slug\":\"darren\",\"url\":\"http://editorial.inspiringquotes.com/author/darren/\",\"profileImageUrl\":\"https://imgblog.inspiringquotes.com/2022/01/download--4-.jpeg\",\"coverImageUrl\":null,\"location\":null,\"bio\":\"Darren lives in Portland, Oregon, has two cats, and writes about science, technology, nature, and history. \",\"website\":null,\"facebookUser\":null,\"twitterUser\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"articlesCount\":null},\"primaryTag\":{\"_id\":\"603166f1b411db00069409e0\",\"slug\":\"history\",\"name\":\"history\",\"visible\":true,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"url\":\"/tag/history\"},\"readingTime\":4,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":\"Speeches have the power to define a moment or rouse people to action, and some are so powerful they echo through the ages.\",\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":\"Speeches have the power to define a moment or rouse people to action, and some are so powerful they echo through the ages.\",\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":\"Speeches have the power to define a moment or rouse people to action, and some are so powerful they echo through the ages.\",\"imageUrl\":null}},\"publishedTs\":\"2022-11-29T01:12:06.000Z\",\"contentTags\":[],\"entityURL\":\"/famous-lines-from-the-most-quoted-speeches-in-history/Y4VbYh5NpAAIKq41\"},{\"_id\":\"638616fe1e4da400082aaecc\",\"_version\":1,\"activeTs\":\"2022-11-29T14:32:22.000Z\",\"createdTs\":\"2022-11-29T14:28:14.000Z\",\"updatedTs\":\"2022-11-29T14:32:22.000Z\",\"hidden\":false,\"title\":\"15 Comforting Quotes About Making Mistakes\",\"slug\":\"15-comforting-quotes-about-making-mistakes\",\"html\":\"<p>In 1711, legendary English poet Alexander Pope composed one of his most famous works, <em>An Essay on Criticism</em>.
