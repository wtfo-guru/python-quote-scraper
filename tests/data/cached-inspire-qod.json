Three of his six siblings died from disease while they were still children, and his father died of pneumonia when Twain was 12. Later, while training as a steamboat pilot, he invited his younger brother, Henry, to come work with him on the riverboat <em>Pennsylvania</em>. Henry was killed when one of the boat\u2019s boilers exploded; Twain was not on board at the time, but he blamed himself for the rest of his life. <br><br></p><h2 id=\\\"twain-s-pen-name-comes-from-his-steamboat-days\\\">Twain\u2019s pen name comes from his steamboat days</h2><p>Twain used a number of peculiar <em>noms de plume </em>before deciding on \u201cMark Twain,\u201d <a href=\\\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/amerlitereal.48.3.0277\\\">including</a> W. Epaminondas Adrastus Blab, Thomas Jefferson Snodgrass, Sergeant Fathom, and Josh. His pseudonym Mark Twain first appeared in print in 1863. Twain himself wrote that his pen name came from his years working on the Mississippi River, where riverboatmen would cry out \u201cmark twain\u201d to indicate a depth of two fathoms (12 feet), which was safe for a steamboat to navigate. <br><br></p><h2 id=\\\"twain-almost-got-himself-into-a-duel\\\">Twain almost got himself into a duel</h2><p>When he was 28, Twain managed to get himself in such a mess that he ended up <a href=\\\"https://storyoftheweek.loa.org/2021/11/how-i-escaped-being-killed-in-duel.html\\\">challenging the editor of a rival newspaper to a duel</a>. It all started with one of Twain\u2019s satirical articles\u2014written while drunk\u2014about a charity fundraiser was published in Virginia City\u2019s <em>Territorial Enterprise</em>. It caused quite a scandal. The precise details of the events have been clouded by conflicting accounts and later embellishments, but at least three challenges to duels were issued, one by Twain himself, and two from men demanding a faceoff with Twain. All the bluster eventually died down without a single shot fired. <br><br></p><h2 id=\\\"twain-preferred-cats-to-people\\\">Twain preferred cats to people</h2><p>At one point in his life, Twain owned 19 cats, with names ranging from Beelzebub to Blatherskite to Buffalo Bill. He was obsessed with cats \u2014 they appear frequently in his stories \u2014 and seemed to prefer their company to that of people. \u201cIf man could be crossed with the cat,\u201d <a href=\\\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/mark-twain-liked-cats-better-people-180965265/\\\">he once wrote</a>, \u201cit would improve man, but it would deteriorate the cat.\\\"<br><br></p><h2 id=\\\"he-was-a-fan-of-inventions-and-inventors\\\">He was a fan of inventions and inventors</h2><p>Twain had a great interest in science and innovation. He himself patented <a href=\\\"https://www.ctexplored.org/mark-twain-inventor/\\\">three inventions</a>: an elastic strap designed to replace suspenders; a history trivia game about European monarchs; and a self-pasting scrapbook. Twain also became great friends with inventors like Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla. Twain and Tesla \u00a0appear in a number of photographs together, and Tesla once <a href=\\\"https://bigthink.com/high-culture/the-secret-to-mark-twains-friendship-with-nikola-tesla/\\\">cured Twain\u2019s constipation</a> by placing the writer on an electromechanical oscillator. <br><br></p><h2 id=\\\"twain-wasn-t-the-world-s-wisest-investor\\\">Twain wasn\u2019t the world\u2019s wisest investor</h2><p>Despite his ingenuity, Twain lost a huge amount of money investing in new inventions and technology. His most disastrous investment was the Paige typesetting machine. He invested around $300,000 on it \u2014 around $8 million today \u2014 only for the machine to be rendered obsolete before it was finished . He also famously turned down the investment of a lifetime: Alexander Graham Bell\u2019s telephone. \u201cI declined,\u201d <a href=\\\"http://oldtelephones.com/blog/2012/04/25/mark-twain-and-the-telephone/\\\">Twain later explained</a>. \u201cI said I didn't want anything more to do with wildcat speculation.\u201d <br><br></p><h2 id=\\\"he-ran-up-a-huge-amount-of-debt-but-paid-it-all-back\\\">He ran up a huge amount of debt \u2014 but paid it all back</h2><p>Twain made good money from his writing, but his terrible investments saw him run up a lot of debt and ultimately file for bankruptcy. Being an honorable man, however, he wanted to make things right. In 1895, he set off on a year-long, <a href=\\\"https://twain.lib.virginia.edu/onstage/world.html\\\">worldwide lecture tour</a>. It was tough going, but by the end he had earned enough to pay off his creditors in full \u2014 even though he was no longer legally obliged to do so. <br><br></p><h2 id=\\\"the-only-known-movie-footage-of-twain-was-shot-by-thomas-edison\\\">The only known movie footage of Twain was shot by Thomas Edison</h2><p>In 1909, Thomas Edison visited Twain at Stormfield House, his home in Redding, Connecticut. Edison took his camera and shot what is believed to be <a href=\\\"https://www.openculture.com/2014/09/the-only-footage-of-mark-twain-the-original-digitally-restored-films.html\\\">the only movie footage of Mark Twain in existence</a>.

Henry was killed when one of the boat\u2019s boilers exploded; Twain was not on board at the time, but he blamed himself for the rest of his life. <br><br></p>\",\"<h2 id=\\\"twain-s-pen-name-comes-from-his-steamboat-days\\\">Twain\u2019s pen name comes from his steamboat days</h2><p>Twain used a number of peculiar <em>noms de plume </em>before deciding on \u201cMark Twain,\u201d <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/amerlitereal.48.3.0277\\\">including</a> W. Epaminondas Adrastus Blab, Thomas Jefferson Snodgrass, Sergeant Fathom, and Josh. His pseudonym Mark Twain first appeared in print in 1863. Twain himself wrote that his pen name came from his years working on the Mississippi River, where riverboatmen would cry out \u201cmark twain\u201d to indicate a depth of two fathoms (12 feet), which was safe for a steamboat to navigate. <br><br></p>\",\"<h2 id=\\\"twain-almost-got-himself-into-a-duel\\\">Twain almost got himself into a duel</h2><p>When he was 28, Twain managed to get himself in such a mess that he ended up <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://storyoftheweek.loa.org/2021/11/how-i-escaped-being-killed-in-duel.html\\\">challenging the editor of a rival newspaper to a duel</a>. It all started with one of Twain\u2019s satirical articles\u2014written while drunk\u2014about a charity fundraiser was published in Virginia City\u2019s <em>Territorial Enterprise</em>. It caused quite a scandal. The precise details of the events have been clouded by conflicting accounts and later embellishments, but at least three challenges to duels were issued, one by Twain himself, and two from men demanding a faceoff with Twain. All the bluster eventually died down without a single shot fired. <br><br></p>\",\"<h2 id=\\\"twain-preferred-cats-to-people\\\">Twain preferred cats to people</h2><p>At one point in his life, Twain owned 19 cats, with names ranging from Beelzebub to Blatherskite to Buffalo Bill. He was obsessed with cats \u2014 they appear frequently in his stories \u2014 and seemed to prefer their company to that of people. \u201cIf man could be crossed with the cat,\u201d <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/mark-twain-liked-cats-better-people-180965265/\\\">he once wrote</a>, \u201cit would improve man, but it would deteriorate the cat.\\\"<br><br></p>\",\"<h2 id=\\\"he-was-a-fan-of-inventions-and-inventors\\\">He was a fan of inventions and inventors</h2><p>Twain had a great interest in science and innovation. He himself patented <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://www.ctexplored.org/mark-twain-inventor/\\\">three inventions</a>: an elastic strap designed to replace suspenders; a history trivia game about European monarchs; and a self-pasting scrapbook. Twain also became great friends with inventors like Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla. Twain and Tesla \u00a0appear in a number of photographs together, and Tesla once <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://bigthink.com/high-culture/the-secret-to-mark-twains-friendship-with-nikola-tesla/\\\">cured Twain\u2019s constipation</a> by placing the writer on an electromechanical oscillator. <br><br></p>\",\"<h2 id=\\\"twain-wasn-t-the-world-s-wisest-investor\\\">Twain wasn\u2019t the world\u2019s wisest investor</h2><p>Despite his ingenuity, Twain lost a huge amount of money investing in new inventions and technology. His most disastrous investment was the Paige typesetting machine. He invested around $300,000 on it \u2014 around $8 million today \u2014 only for the machine to be rendered obsolete before it was finished . He also famously turned down the investment of a lifetime: Alexander Graham Bell\u2019s telephone. \u201cI declined,\u201d <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http://oldtelephones.com/blog/2012/04/25/mark-twain-and-the-telephone/\\\">Twain later explained</a>. \u201cI said I didn't want anything more to do with wildcat speculation.\u201d <br><br></p>\",\"<h2 id=\\\"he-ran-up-a-huge-amount-of-debt-but-paid-it-all-back\\\">He ran up a huge amount of debt \u2014 but paid it all back</h2><p>Twain made good money from his writing, but his terrible investments saw him run up a lot of debt and ultimately file for bankruptcy. Being an honorable man, however, he wanted to make things right. In 1895, he set off on a year-long, <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://twain.lib.virginia.edu/onstage/world.html\\\">worldwide lecture tour</a>. It was tough going, but by the end he had earned enough to pay off his creditors in full \u2014 even though he was no longer legally obliged to do so. <br><br></p>\",\"<h2 id=\\\"the-only-known-movie-footage-of-twain-was-shot-by-thomas-edison\\\">The only known movie footage of Twain was shot by Thomas Edison</h2><p>In 1909, Thomas Edison visited Twain at Stormfield House, his home in Redding, Connecticut.

He went from rags to riches and back to rags, from high society to living largely as a recluse whose only friends were the local pigeons he visited every day. He was eccentric, but he was also a genius best known for inventing the modern alternating current electricity supply system. In 1934, in an interview with \u201cThe New York Times,\u201d Tesla explained in part what helped his genius thrive.

Other writing systems later emerged independently in nearly every corner of the world, from Egypt to China to Mesoamerica. </p><p>But why do we write? Fundamentally, we write as a form of communication with others \u2014 and with future generations. Carl Sagan, the great astronomer, author, and science communicator, <a href=\\\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/05/08/carl-sagan-on-books/\\\">called writing</a> \u201cperhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs.\u201d We also write for ourselves, whether privately or with the intention of sharing it later.

From the kindhearted Kermit to the affable Fozzie Bear, the wacky, smart, and flamboyant characters were a hit. In 1969, the Muppets appeared on the wildly successful children\u2019s program <em>Sesame Street,</em> and by 1976, the popularity of the colorful cast led to a half-hour of prime time called <em>The Muppet Show</em>. In its five-year run, the show won four Emmy Awards and was nominated for another 21. </p><p>Even as the showrunners took home their awards, the Muppets were just getting started. In 1979, they starred in the first of several movies, <em>The Muppet Movie</em>. The 1980s and '90s brought a number of spinoffs, including <em>Muppet Babies</em>, <em>Muppets Tonight</em>, and <em>The Jim Henson Hour</em>. The characters have also appeared on late-night TV talk shows, and made cameo appearances on everything from <em>The Simpsons</em> to <em>The West Wing</em>.</p><p>After six decades in the spotlight, the Muppets continue to shine. Their message of friendship, love, and laughter is as relevant today as it has ever been.

From the kindhearted Kermit to the affable Fozzie Bear, the wacky, smart, and flamboyant characters were a hit. In 1969, the Muppets appeared on the wildly successful children\u2019s program <em>Sesame Street,</em> and by 1976, the popularity of the colorful cast led to a half-hour of prime time called <em>The Muppet Show</em>. In its five-year run, the show won four Emmy Awards and was nominated for another 21. </p><p>Even as the showrunners took home their awards, the Muppets were just getting started. In 1979, they starred in the first of several movies, <em>The Muppet Movie</em>. The 1980s and '90s brought a number of spinoffs, including <em>Muppet Babies</em>, <em>Muppets Tonight</em>, and <em>The Jim Henson Hour</em>. The characters have also appeared on late-night TV talk shows, and made cameo appearances on everything from <em>The Simpsons</em> to <em>The West Wing</em>.</p><p>After six decades in the spotlight, the Muppets continue to shine. Their message of friendship, love, and laughter is as relevant today as it has ever been.

The essay explored a range of themes, from gender inequality and the subjectivity of truth, to the nature of creativity and the need for financial independence.

What is my fundamental purpose? Why do I exist?</em> If you\u2019ve ever found yourself pondering such questions, you\u2019ve been dabbling in existentialist philosophy. The concept, however, is not easy to define. It can take diverse and sometimes contrasting directions \u2014 and many of the major names in existentialism, including Albert Camus and Martin Heidegger, didn\u2019t even accept the label. </p><p>Existentialism has its roots in the 19th century, with the philosophers S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard in Denmark and Friedrich Nietzsche in Germany, as well as the Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky. These great thinkers were critical of rationalism and its adherence to pure reason, and instead focused on the question of meaning. One of the earliest statements of existentialist thought comes from a journal entry written by Kierkegaard in 1835: \u201cWhat I really need is to get clear about what I must do, not what I must know\u2026 the crucial thing is to find a truth which is truth for me, to find the idea for which I am willing to live and die.\u201d</p><p>Existentialism flourished in Europe from around 1930 to the mid-20th century, championed by the likes of Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, and Simone de Beauvoir, a trio whose frequent meetings in Parisian caf\u00e9s have become the stuff of literary legend. And while many of the leading existentialists of the 20th century disagreed about its tenets, there are certain shared elements that form the foundation of existentialism today. <br></p><h2 id=\\\"we-determine-our-own-lives\\\">We determine our own lives<br></h2><p>Existentialism argues that we are defined by our existence as humans, and are responsible for finding meaning in our own individual lives. In existentialism, no omnipotent being or force determines a person\u2019s life; rather, it\u2019s up to each individual to set the course through our actions and decisions.

For Kafka, the human condition is beyond tragic or depressed: It is absurd. Camus, meanwhile, argued that absurdity arises when an individual\u2019s search for order clashes with the world\u2019s inherent lack of order. This is not necessarily a bad thing if we have the courage to accept it, <a href=\\\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/07/24/albert-camus-interview-absurd/\\\">Camus suggested</a>: \u201cAccepting the absurdity of everything around us is one step, a necessary experience: it should not become a dead end.

But if, as they say, we have been thrown into an absurd world, then the existentialists ask us to consider why, by exploring the meaning, purpose, and value of human existence. The philosophy also challenges us to strive for authenticity \u2014 to be true to ourselves. The concept of authenticity can vary from one existential philosopher to the next but, generally speaking, inauthenticity involves a form of social conformism and \u201cbad faith,\u201d whereas authenticity requires the individual to own up to their own existence, to accept it and take responsibility for it. This can lead to angst and alienation, but these are accepted as an integral part of authentic living. <br></p><p>As for the conclusions of the existentialist philosophers? Well, they are rarely set in stone, like existentialism itself. In Sartre\u2019s <em>Nausea</em>, the main theme is that \u201cexistence precedes essence\u201d \u2014 that humans do not possess any inherent identity or value, but rather create it themselves as individuals. In Camus\u2019 <em>The Stranger</em>, we see the nakedness of man faced with the absurd. And in <em>Either/Or</em>, Kierkegaard concludes that \u201cthere are two possible situations \u2014 one can either do this or that. My honest opinion and my friendly advice is this: do it or do not do it \u2014 you will regret both.\u201d So, again, don\u2019t expect concrete answers from the existentialists. But perhaps we can take Kafka\u2019s words here as a guidepost for how to think about life, by finding meaning in the simple fact of existence itself. In a heartbreaking <a href=\\\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/03/05/franz-kafka-letter-father/\\\">letter to his abusive father</a> \u2014 a letter his father never even read \u2014 Kafka wrote, \u201cIt is, after all, not necessary to fly right into the middle of the sun, but it is necessary to crawl to a clean little spot on Earth where the sun sometimes shines and one can warm oneself a little.\u201d <br></p><p>Photo credit: Milad Fakurian/ Unsplash</p>\",\"htmlChunks\":[\"<p><em>What is the meaning of life? What is my fundamental purpose? Why do I exist?</em> If you\u2019ve ever found yourself pondering such questions, you\u2019ve been dabbling in existentialist philosophy. The concept, however, is not easy to define. It can take diverse and sometimes contrasting directions \u2014 and many of the major names in existentialism, including Albert Camus and Martin Heidegger, didn\u2019t even accept the label. </p><p>Existentialism has its roots in the 19th century, with the philosophers S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard in Denmark and Friedrich Nietzsche in Germany, as well as the Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky. These great thinkers were critical of rationalism and its adherence to pure reason, and instead focused on the question of meaning. One of the earliest statements of existentialist thought comes from a journal entry written by Kierkegaard in 1835: \u201cWhat I really need is to get clear about what I must do, not what I must know\u2026 the crucial thing is to find a truth which is truth for me, to find the idea for which I am willing to live and die.\u201d</p><p>Existentialism flourished in Europe from around 1930 to the mid-20th century, championed by the likes of Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, and Simone de Beauvoir, a trio whose frequent meetings in Parisian caf\u00e9s have become the stuff of literary legend. And while many of the leading existentialists of the 20th century disagreed about its tenets, there are certain shared elements that form the foundation of existentialism today. <br></p>\",\"<h2 id=\\\"we-determine-our-own-lives\\\">We determine our own lives<br></h2><p>Existentialism argues that we are defined by our existence as humans, and are responsible for finding meaning in our own individual lives.

The term was first coined by a Hungarian American researcher named Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in 1990, when he documented and analyzed reports of this heightened state from athletes, painters, and musicians alike. They all described how, when they were \u201cin the flow,\u201d distractions fell away, time seemed to warp, and ideas floated up seemingly out of nowhere. </p><p>Initially, Csikszentmihalyi theorized that flow occurred when the challenge of a given task perfectly matched the ability of the person doing the work. But over the subsequent decades of research, scientists discovered that the levels of challenge and ability are actually only part of a complex picture. Flow, we now know, is directly related to focus. </p><p>The human brain, much like a computer, has limited processing power, and intense focus on a specific task limits the brian\u2019s ability to organize input from other sources. As a result, when we are in a state of heightened focus, we literally cannot spare a thought to compare ourselves to others or notice the minute hand on the clock. </p><p>Still, for all the science around flow, this zen-like zone of productivity and creativity remains elusive. Cultivating the kind of focus required to tap into a state of flow takes practice and training, but it is well worth the effort. Here, we\u2019ve collected 16 quotes on flow that demonstrate how different people across different disciplines experience this hyper-focused state of mind.</p><p></p><blockquote>When I step onto the court, I don't have to think about anything. If I have a problem off the court, I find that after I play, my mind is clearer and I can come up with a better solution. It's like therapy.

The term was first coined by a Hungarian American researcher named Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in 1990, when he documented and analyzed reports of this heightened state from athletes, painters, and musicians alike. They all described how, when they were \u201cin the flow,\u201d distractions fell away, time seemed to warp, and ideas floated up seemingly out of nowhere. </p><p>Initially, Csikszentmihalyi theorized that flow occurred when the challenge of a given task perfectly matched the ability of the person doing the work. But over the subsequent decades of research, scientists discovered that the levels of challenge and ability are actually only part of a complex picture. Flow, we now know, is directly related to focus. </p><p>The human brain, much like a computer, has limited processing power, and intense focus on a specific task limits the brian\u2019s ability to organize input from other sources. As a result, when we are in a state of heightened focus, we literally cannot spare a thought to compare ourselves to others or notice the minute hand on the clock. </p><p>Still, for all the science around flow, this zen-like zone of productivity and creativity remains elusive. Cultivating the kind of focus required to tap into a state of flow takes practice and training, but it is well worth the effort. Here, we\u2019ve collected 16 quotes on flow that demonstrate how different people across different disciplines experience this hyper-focused state of mind.</p><p></p><blockquote>When I step onto the court, I don't have to think about anything. If I have a problem off the court, I find that after I play, my mind is clearer and I can come up with a better solution. It's like therapy.

But just because we find ourselves distanced from someone doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re gone forever, and that time apart can even strengthen a bond. Reconnecting with loved ones can prove to be a beautifully fulfilling experience. Relationships may fade over time, but they also resurge, and the choice to reunite can make a connection that much sweeter.</p><p>What\u2019s more, a renewed relationship doesn\u2019t always have to involve other people \u2014 it can be just as valuable to look inward and reconnect with ourselves.

We might, for example, be familiar with the expression, \u201cHope springs eternal,\u201d but how many people know what poem it comes from without looking it up? (It\u2019s from Alexander Pope\u2019s 18th-century work \u201cAn Essay on Man.\u201d) </p><p>In honor of these memorable verses, here are the stories behind some of the most famous lines of poetry in history, from William Shakespeare to Gertrude Stein.</p><p></p><blockquote>Shall I compare thee to a summer\u2019s day?<br><em>\u2014 William Shakespeare, \u201cSonnet 18\u201d</em></blockquote><p>Shakespeare is best known for his 39 plays, but he also wrote 154 sonnets (which, in Shakespeare\u2019s case, largely follow the same rhyme scheme and 14-line length). His sonnets, like his plays, contain many famous phrases, none more so than the opening line of \u201cSonnet 18.\u201d</p><p></p><blockquote>Tell me, what is it you plan to do / with your one wild and precious life?<br><em>\u2014 Mary Oliver, \u201cThe Summer Day\u201d</em></blockquote><p>The accessible nature of Mary Oliver\u2019s poetry helped make her one of the bestselling \u2014 and best-loved \u2014 poets in the United States. She wrote many quotable lines, but this stirring probe may be her most famous.</p><p></p><blockquote>To err is human; to forgive, divine.<br><em>\u2014 Alexander Pope, \u201cAn Essay on Criticism\u201d</em></blockquote><p>Alexander Pope\u2019s verse argued that bad criticism does more harm than bad writing, and that poets are made and not born. The piece gave us a number of other famous lines, including \u201cA little learning is a dang'rous thing\u201d and \u201cFools rush in where angels fear to tread.\u201d</p><p></p><blockquote>I wandered lonely as a cloud / That floats on high o'er vales and hills<br><em>\u2014 William Wordsworth, \u201cI Wandered Lonely as a Cloud\\\"</em></blockquote><p>Many poems have been inspired by long walks in the countryside, and Wordsworth\u2019s \u201cDaffodils,\u201d as it is also known, is no exception. The poem had its critics upon publication, but is now considered a classic of English Romantic poetry.</p><p></p><blockquote>This is the way the world ends / Not with a bang but a whimper.<br><em>\u2014 T.S. Eliot, \u201cThe Hollow Men\u201d</em></blockquote><p>Published in 1925, Eliot\u2019s poem examines the feelings of hopelessness, disarray, and religious confusion in Europe in the wake of the First World War. The poem has since been referenced in many other works, from Stephen King\u2019s novel <em>Pet Sematary</em> to movies such as <em>Apocalypse Now</em> and <em>Tenet</em>.</p><p></p><blockquote>\u2018Tis better to have loved and lost / Than never to have loved at all.<br><em>\u2014 Alfred, Lord Tennyson, \u201cIn Memoriam A.H.H.\u201d</em></blockquote><p>Published in 1850, Alfred, Lord Tennyson\u2019s \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d is a requiem for the poet\u2019s friend Arthur Henry Hallam, who died suddenly at the age of 22. Tennyson\u2019s examination and portrayal of grief spans 2,916 lines, in what is widely considered one of the greatest poems of the 19th century.</p><p></p><blockquote>Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose.<br><em>\u2014 Gertrude Stein, \u201cSacred Emily\u201d</em></blockquote><p>Gertrude Stein\u2019s first \u201cRose\u201d in this line refers to an actual person, while the subsequent repetition of the famously romantic flower has been interpreted as meaning \u201cthings are what they are.\u201d Stein herself stated that she was trying to give the rose back its identity, saying, \u201cI think in that line the rose is red for the first time in English poetry for a hundred years.\u201d</p><p></p><blockquote>Do not go gentle into that good night. / Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br><em>\u2014 Dylan Thomas, \u201cDo not go gentle into that good night\u201d</em></blockquote><p>Few works of literature better capture the threshold of death than Dylan Thomas\u2019 hugely emotive poem. The repeated refrain of \u201cRage, rage against the dying of the light\u201d is spoken to a dying father; Thomas\u2019 own father died five years after the poem was written.</p><p></p><blockquote>In Xanadu did Kubla Khan / A stately pleasure dome decree<br><em>\u2014 Samuel Taylor Coleridge, \u201cKubla Khan\u201d</em></blockquote><p>The trippy nature of \u201cKubla Khan\u201d comes as little surprise considering Samuel Taylor Coleridge composed the poem after experiencing an opium-influenced dream. Coleridge wrote the piece in 1797, and it wasn\u2019t published until 1816, when Lord Byron convinced him to make it public.</p><p></p><blockquote>Beauty is truth, truth beauty, \u2014 that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.<br><em>\u2014 John Keats, \u201cOde on a Grecian Urn\u201d</em></blockquote><p>Keats\u2019 contemplation of a Greek urn has had critics in a tizzy since its publication in 1819. Variously derided and celebrated as either delightfully enigmatic or downright silly, it is now considered one of the greatest odes in the English language \u2014 and its final comment on truth and beauty continues to provoke much debate.</p><p></p><blockquote>When I am an old woman I shall wear purple / With a red hat which doesn't go, and doesn't suit me.<br><em>\u2014 Jenny Joseph, \u201cWarning\u201d</em></blockquote><p>Written in 1961, \u201cWarning\u201d is a well-loved poem in which a woman imagines herself in old age as a cheeky, fun-loving, and unapologetic senior determined to make the most of her advancing years.</p><p></p><blockquote>He was my North, my South, my East and West, / My working week and my Sunday rest<br><em>\u2014 W.H. Auden, \u201cFuneral Blues\u201d</em></blockquote><p>\u201cFuneral Blues,\u201d also known as \u201cStop All the Clocks,\u201d is a touching elegy that beautifully describes the pain and isolation following the loss of a loved one. It originally appeared in the 1936 play The Ascent of F6, and later gained greater popularity when it was read in the 1994 movie <em>Four Weddings and a Funeral</em>.</p><p></p><p>Photo credit: MET/ BOT/ Alamy Stock Photo</p>\",\"htmlChunks\":[\"<p>It\u2019s always impressive when someone can recite an entire poem by memory, but most of us can at least quote a few famous poetic lines \u2014 some of which have become so popular, they\u2019ve entered the English language as common expressions.

Variously derided and celebrated as either delightfully enigmatic or downright silly, it is now considered one of the greatest odes in the English language \u2014 and its final comment on truth and beauty continues to provoke much debate.</p><p></p><blockquote>When I am an old woman I shall wear purple / With a red hat which doesn't go, and doesn't suit me.<br><em>\u2014 Jenny Joseph, \u201cWarning\u201d</em></blockquote><p>Written in 1961, \u201cWarning\u201d is a well-loved poem in which a woman imagines herself in old age as a cheeky, fun-loving, and unapologetic senior determined to make the most of her advancing years.</p><p></p><blockquote>He was my North, my South, my East and West, / My working week and my Sunday rest<br><em>\u2014 W.H. Auden, \u201cFuneral Blues\u201d</em></blockquote><p>\u201cFuneral Blues,\u201d also known as \u201cStop All the Clocks,\u201d is a touching elegy that beautifully describes the pain and isolation following the loss of a loved one. It originally appeared in the 1936 play The Ascent of F6, and later gained greater popularity when it was read in the 1994 movie <em>Four Weddings and a Funeral</em>.</p><p></p><p>Photo credit: MET/ BOT/ Alamy Stock Photo</p>\"],\"excerpt\":\"Here are the stories behind some of the greatest poetic lines in history, from William Shakespeare to Gertrude Stein.\",\"imageUrl\":\"https://imgblog.inspiringquotes.com/2022/11/IQ-Articles-Most-Famous-Poetry.jpg\",\"featured\":false,\"tags\":[{\"_id\":\"602f03b5b411db000694099f\",\"slug\":\"literature\",\"name\":\"literature\",\"visible\":true,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"url\":\"/tag/literature\"}],\"authors\":[{\"_id\":\"603852eab411db0006940a88\",\"name\":\"Tony Dunnell\",\"slug\":\"tony\",\"url\":\"http://editorial.inspiringquotes.com/author/tony/\",\"profileImageUrl\":\"https://imgblog.inspiringquotes.com/2021/02/profile-pic.jpg\",\"coverImageUrl\":null,\"location\":null,\"bio\":\"Tony is an English writer of non-fiction and fiction living on the edge of the Amazon jungle.\",\"website\":null,\"facebookUser\":null,\"twitterUser\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"articlesCount\":null}],\"primaryAuthor\":{\"_id\":\"603852eab411db0006940a88\",\"name\":\"Tony Dunnell\",\"slug\":\"tony\",\"url\":\"http://editorial.inspiringquotes.com/author/tony/\",\"profileImageUrl\":\"https://imgblog.inspiringquotes.com/2021/02/profile-pic.jpg\",\"coverImageUrl\":null,\"location\":null,\"bio\":\"Tony is an English writer of non-fiction and fiction living on the edge of the Amazon jungle.\",\"website\":null,\"facebookUser\":null,\"twitterUser\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"articlesCount\":null},\"primaryTag\":{\"_id\":\"602f03b5b411db000694099f\",\"slug\":\"literature\",\"name\":\"literature\",\"visible\":true,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"url\":\"/tag/literature\"},\"readingTime\":4,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":\"Here are the stories behind some of the greatest poetic lines in history, from William Shakespeare to Gertrude Stein.\",\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":\"Here are the stories behind some of the greatest poetic lines in history, from William Shakespeare to Gertrude Stein.\",\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":\"Here are the stories behind some of the greatest poetic lines in history, from William Shakespeare to Gertrude Stein.\",\"imageUrl\":null}},\"publishedTs\":\"2022-11-29T14:37:56.000Z\",\"contentTags\":[],\"entityURL\":\"/12-famous-lines-of-poetry-and-where-they-come-from/Y4YYGR5NpAAIKq7l\"},{\"_id\":\"638559681e4da400082aae1a\",\"_version\":1,\"activeTs\":\"2022-11-29T01:06:38.000Z\",\"createdTs\":\"2022-11-29T00:59:20.000Z\",\"updatedTs\":\"2022-11-29T01:06:38.000Z\",\"hidden\":false,\"title\":\"Meghan Markle\u2019s Most Empowering Quotes\",\"slug\":\"meghan-markles-most-empowering-quotes\",\"html\":\"<p>Meghan Markle started working to make the world a more inclusive place long before she became a household name.

But his political philosophy of the \u201cgeneral will\u201d \u2014 a collective will that aims at the common good \u2014 had a more lasting influence than any aria, shaping governments across the world.</p><p>In the 1760s, Rousseau was in his 50s and monarchs were still ruling Europe.

Society was expanding at the time, and people were growing more dependent on others for survival. A strong state was necessary to help ensure equality and justice \u2014 but how could you build strong political institutions, endowed with the power and authority needed to maintain order, while still protecting individual freedoms? </p><p>Rousseau\u2019s solution was his theory of \u201c<a href=\\\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rousseau/#PoliPhil\\\">general will</a>.\u201d He believed that under a monarchy or dictatorship, laws routinely impinged on freedoms because the rulers knew or cared little about what was best for the common people. He argued that in order to protect the freedoms of the public, laws had to be determined by the collective will (or general will) of the citizenry, based on the common good. And the best tool to interpret the general will was democracy \u2014 a state governed by the people.</p><p>Rousseau believed that a democratic system was the only way to serve the collective will, but he admitted that this form of government was difficult to pull off in practicality.

Today, many of society\u2019s political issues continue to revolve around the fundamental tension Rousseau identified: How best to balance personal freedoms with state power?<br></p><h2 id=\\\"schopenhauer-s-theory-of-aesthetics\\\">Schopenhauer\u2019s Theory of Aesthetics</h2><p>German philosopher <a href=\\\"https://iep.utm.edu/schopenh/\\\">Arthur Schopenhauer</a> was a famous curmudgeon, a wild-haired pessimist who notably helped introduce Western intellectuals to Indian philosophy in the 19th century. His writings, however, would forever change <a href=\\\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schopenhauer-aesthetics/\\\">the way we think about art</a>. \u00a0</p><p>Before Schopenhauer, most artwork \u2014 from music to painting to dance \u2014 was considered a frivolous diversion, akin to a decorative craft, rather than an expression of creative genius or a person\u2019s innermost feelings. Schopenhauer helped change those attitudes with his theory about the human will. The essence of his philosophy is that we are held captive by our wills \u2014 our strivings, desires, and urges \u2014 and are thus doomed to suffer. He observed, \\\"A man can surely do what he wills to do, but cannot determine what he wills.\u201d</p><p>One way to escape this suffering, Schopenhauer argued, was through aesthetic experiences. He believed art can function as a quasi-religious experience, freeing us from the suffering of our own desires and serving as a source of inspiration. In his essay <a href=\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/131132-nachtr-ge-zur-lehre-vom-leiden-der-welt\\\"><em>On the Suffering of the World</em></a><em>,</em> Schopenhauer wrote, \\\"The true work of art leads us from that which exists only once and never again, i.e. the individual, to that which exists perpetually and time and time again in innumerable manifestations, the pure form or Idea.\\\" </p><p>Schopenhauer argued that great art was the product not of mere craftsmen, but of genius. Naturally, a lot of artists were fans of Schopenhauer\u2019s <a href=\\\"https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195378948.001.0001/acprof-9780195378948-chapter-4\\\">thoughts on aesthetics</a>. Composer Richard Wagner, novelist Leo Tolstoy, and reams of other creatives trumpeted his work, which elevated art to a higher plane. Tolstoy himself stated, \\\"Art lifts man from his personal life into the universal life.\\\" </p><p>Thanks to Schopenhauer\u2019s theories, artists and artwork started being lauded as vital and necessary to the health of society. A canon of famous masterpieces was created, as people viewed creators with a growing God-like reverence. This attitude toward art helped define the 19th-century Romanticism movement, and it still persists today.<br></p><h2 id=\\\"descartes-dualism-and-rationalism\\\">Descartes\u2019 Dualism and Rationalism</h2><p>\u201cI think, therefore I am.\u201d More than a catchy quote, the famous declaration by the French philosopher <a href=\\\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-epistemology/\\\">Ren\u00e9 Descartes</a> continues to shape the way we think about knowledge. And it all started in the 17th century with Descartes\u2019 method of \u201c<a href=\\\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691117324/descartess-method-of-doubt\\\">radical doubt</a>,\u201d which he saw as the only way to be certain that the things we think we know are in fact undeniable truths. </p><p>At the time, it was a common belief that we acquire knowledge through senses such as touch and sight. The skeptical Descartes, however, pointed out the senses could be deceiving. (A person, after all, could be hallucinating or dreaming.) That begged the question: If the senses aren\u2019t trustworthy, what\u2019s stopping us from doubting everything, including our own existence? Descartes eventually concluded, \u201cCogito, ergo sum\u201d \u2014 \u201cI think, therefore I am.\u201d The fact that you can doubt your own existence, the philosopher said, is proof that you exist. </p><p>Descartes argued that the conscious mind is not part of the senses, or the physical world at all, but that the mind and body are distinct and separate entities. He said, \\\"When I was examining what I was, I realized that I could pretend that I had no body\u2026 but I could not pretend in the same way that I did not exist.\\\" This theory, dubbed <a href=\\\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/\\\">Cartesian dualism</a>, was widely adopted by thinkers across the West.</p><p>To Descartes, trusting the mind was of the utmost importance, as the philosopher valued human logic and reason above all else. One of the founders of modern rationalism, he believed knowledge could only be attained by individual reason (versus, say, faith or experience), and that answers to the most perplexing questions could be found simply by exercising doubt and critical thought. His idea that beliefs must be methodically tested by logic and skepticism led to a flourishing of scientific thought, laying the groundwork for Enlightenment thinking and debate throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. <br></p><h2 id=\\\"plato-s-theory-of-forms\\\">Plato\u2019s Theory of Forms</h2><p>It\u2019s easy to close our eyes and imagine a perfect circle, but if we open our eyes and try to draw one, it\u2019s a very different story. That\u2019s <a href=\\\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-metaphysics/\\\">Plato\u2019s metaphysics</a> in a nutshell: While most of us can conceive of a perfect circle, none of us can recreate one. </p><p>The ancient Greek philosopher posited that every object on Earth is imperfect (like the circle we draw) but possesses an ideal \u201cform\u201d or \u201cessence\u201d (like the perfect circle in our mind). While forms are unchangeable, pure, and ideal, the objects on Earth are mere \u201cshadows\u201d \u2014 or blemished imitations \u2014 of those forms. </p><p>While it may sound overly abstract, Plato\u2019s Theory of Forms proved to be a useful way to think about the world. Recognizing a thing\u2019s ideal form can help us understand how it falls short in reality, and thus what needs to be changed or improved. In other words, the ideal can serve as a goal to better both society and ourselves. As Plato said, \u201cFor a man to conquer himself is the first and noblest of all victories.\u201d</p><p>For example, replace the idea of the perfect circle with the perfect justice system. Many people believe that a truly fair, ideal system of justice exists, but that the current system falls short of that vision. Our belief that a standard, fixed, and ideal justice system is out there as a goal to aim toward is fundamentally Platonic. </p><p>Though <a href=\\\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/essential-accidental/\\\">essentialism</a> \u2014 the belief that all things possess inherent, discoverable qualities \u2014 has long been controversial, Plato\u2019s Theory of Forms helped shape Western philosophy. His work influenced the theories of many thinkers over the following centuries who built on, or challenged, Plato\u2019s ideas, forming schools of thought that continue to impact how we understand the nature of our reality, and our own existence in the world.</p><p></p><p>Photo credit: Bettmann via Getty Images<br></p>\",\"htmlChunks\":[\"<p>Some philosophical theories are so powerful, they shape the way we think and act without us even noticing.

His writings, however, would forever change <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schopenhauer-aesthetics/\\\">the way we think about art</a>. \u00a0</p><p>Before Schopenhauer, most artwork \u2014 from music to painting to dance \u2014 was considered a frivolous diversion, akin to a decorative craft, rather than an expression of creative genius or a person\u2019s innermost feelings. Schopenhauer helped change those attitudes with his theory about the human will. The essence of his philosophy is that we are held captive by our wills \u2014 our strivings, desires, and urges \u2014 and are thus doomed to suffer. He observed, \\\"A man can surely do what he wills to do, but cannot determine what he wills.\u201d</p><p>One way to escape this suffering, Schopenhauer argued, was through aesthetic experiences. He believed art can function as a quasi-religious experience, freeing us from the suffering of our own desires and serving as a source of inspiration. In his essay <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/131132-nachtr-ge-zur-lehre-vom-leiden-der-welt\\\"><em>On the Suffering of the World</em></a><em>,</em> Schopenhauer wrote, \\\"The true work of art leads us from that which exists only once and never again, i.e. the individual, to that which exists perpetually and time and time again in innumerable manifestations, the pure form or Idea.\\\" </p><p>Schopenhauer argued that great art was the product not of mere craftsmen, but of genius. Naturally, a lot of artists were fans of Schopenhauer\u2019s <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195378948.001.0001/acprof-9780195378948-chapter-4\\\">thoughts on aesthetics</a>. Composer Richard Wagner, novelist Leo Tolstoy, and reams of other creatives trumpeted his work, which elevated art to a higher plane. Tolstoy himself stated, \\\"Art lifts man from his personal life into the universal life.\\\" </p><p>Thanks to Schopenhauer\u2019s theories, artists and artwork started being lauded as vital and necessary to the health of society. A canon of famous masterpieces was created, as people viewed creators with a growing God-like reverence. This attitude toward art helped define the 19th-century Romanticism movement, and it still persists today.<br></p>\",\"<h2 id=\\\"descartes-dualism-and-rationalism\\\">Descartes\u2019 Dualism and Rationalism</h2><p>\u201cI think, therefore I am.\u201d More than a catchy quote, the famous declaration by the French philosopher <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-epistemology/\\\">Ren\u00e9 Descartes</a> continues to shape the way we think about knowledge. And it all started in the 17th century with Descartes\u2019 method of \u201c<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691117324/descartess-method-of-doubt\\\">radical doubt</a>,\u201d which he saw as the only way to be certain that the things we think we know are in fact undeniable truths. </p><p>At the time, it was a common belief that we acquire knowledge through senses such as touch and sight. The skeptical Descartes, however, pointed out the senses could be deceiving. (A person, after all, could be hallucinating or dreaming.) That begged the question: If the senses aren\u2019t trustworthy, what\u2019s stopping us from doubting everything, including our own existence? Descartes eventually concluded, \u201cCogito, ergo sum\u201d \u2014 \u201cI think, therefore I am.\u201d The fact that you can doubt your own existence, the philosopher said, is proof that you exist. </p><p>Descartes argued that the conscious mind is not part of the senses, or the physical world at all, but that the mind and body are distinct and separate entities. He said, \\\"When I was examining what I was, I realized that I could pretend that I had no body\u2026 but I could not pretend in the same way that I did not exist.\\\" This theory, dubbed <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/\\\">Cartesian dualism</a>, was widely adopted by thinkers across the West.</p><p>To Descartes, trusting the mind was of the utmost importance, as the philosopher valued human logic and reason above all else. One of the founders of modern rationalism, he believed knowledge could only be attained by individual reason (versus, say, faith or experience), and that answers to the most perplexing questions could be found simply by exercising doubt and critical thought. His idea that beliefs must be methodically tested by logic and skepticism led to a flourishing of scientific thought, laying the groundwork for Enlightenment thinking and debate throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. <br></p>\",\"<h2 id=\\\"plato-s-theory-of-forms\\\">Plato\u2019s Theory of Forms</h2><p>It\u2019s easy to close our eyes and imagine a perfect circle, but if we open our eyes and try to draw one, it\u2019s a very different story. That\u2019s <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-metaphysics/\\\">Plato\u2019s metaphysics</a> in a nutshell: While most of us can conceive of a perfect circle, none of us can recreate one. </p><p>The ancient Greek philosopher posited that every object on Earth is imperfect (like the circle we draw) but possesses an ideal \u201cform\u201d or \u201cessence\u201d (like the perfect circle in our mind). While forms are unchangeable, pure, and ideal, the objects on Earth are mere \u201cshadows\u201d \u2014 or blemished imitations \u2014 of those forms. </p><p>While it may sound overly abstract, Plato\u2019s Theory of Forms proved to be a useful way to think about the world. Recognizing a thing\u2019s ideal form can help us understand how it falls short in reality, and thus what needs to be changed or improved. In other words, the ideal can serve as a goal to better both society and ourselves. As Plato said, \u201cFor a man to conquer himself is the first and noblest of all victories.\u201d</p><p>For example, replace the idea of the perfect circle with the perfect justice system. Many people believe that a truly fair, ideal system of justice exists, but that the current system falls short of that vision. Our belief that a standard, fixed, and ideal justice system is out there as a goal to aim toward is fundamentally Platonic. </p><p>Though <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/essential-accidental/\\\">essentialism</a> \u2014 the belief that all things possess inherent, discoverable qualities \u2014 has long been controversial, Plato\u2019s Theory of Forms helped shape Western philosophy. His work influenced the theories of many thinkers over the following centuries who built on, or challenged, Plato\u2019s ideas, forming schools of thought that continue to impact how we understand the nature of our reality, and our own existence in the world.</p><p></p><p>Photo credit: Bettmann via Getty Images<br></p>\"],\"excerpt\":\"We\u2019ve broken down six major Western philosophical ideas, from Nietzsche\u2019s nihilism to Platonic metaphysics.\",\"imageUrl\":\"https://imgblog.inspiringquotes.com/2022/11/IQ-Major-Philosophies.jpg\",\"featured\":false,\"tags\":[{\"_id\":\"6021bfdb012afd0006cfddd8\",\"slug\":\"wisdom\",\"name\":\"Wisdom\",\"visible\":true,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"url\":\"/tag/wisdom\"},{\"_id\":\"602f03b5b411db000694099f\",\"slug\":\"literature\",\"name\":\"literature\",\"visible\":true,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":false,\"url\":\"/tag/literature\"}],\"authors\":[{\"_id\":\"637baa271e4da400082aacfb\",\"name\":\"Inspiring Quotes Staff\",\"slug\":\"inspiring\",\"url\":\"http://editorial.inspiringquotes.com/author/inspiring/\",\"profileImageUrl\":\"https://imgblog.inspiringquotes.com/2022/11/Group-722.jpg\",\"coverImageUrl\":null,\"location\":null,\"bio\":null,\"website\":null,\"facebookUser\":null,\"twitterUser\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"articlesCount\":null}],\"primaryAuthor\":{\"_id\":\"637baa271e4da400082aacfb\",\"name\":\"Inspiring Quotes Staff\",\"slug\":\"inspiring\",\"url\":\"http://editorial.inspiringquotes.com/author/inspiring/\",\"profileImageUrl\":\"https://imgblog.inspiringquotes.com/2022/11/Group-722.jpg\",\"coverImageUrl\":null,\"location\":null,\"bio\":null,\"website\":null,\"facebookUser\":null,\"twitterUser\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"articlesCount\":null},\"primaryTag\":{\"_id\":\"6021bfdb012afd0006cfddd8\",\"slug\":\"wisdom\",\"name\":\"Wisdom\",\"visible\":true,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"url\":\"/tag/wisdom\"},\"readingTime\":8,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":\"We\u2019ve broken down six major Western philosophical ideas, from Nietzsche\u2019s nihilism to Platonic metaphysics.\",\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":\"We\u2019ve broken down six major Western philosophical ideas, from Nietzsche\u2019s nihilism to Platonic metaphysics.\",\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":\"We\u2019ve broken down six major Western philosophical ideas, from Nietzsche\u2019s nihilism to Platonic metaphysics.\",\"imageUrl\":null}},\"publishedTs\":\"2022-11-22T14:30:47.000Z\",\"contentTags\":[],\"entityURL\":\"/a-beginners-guide-to-the-major-philosophies/Y3waER5NpAAIKq1v\"},{\"_id\":\"632920463146070007e59190\",\"_version\":1,\"activeTs\":\"2022-09-20T02:12:06.000Z\",\"createdTs\":\"2022-09-20T02:07:02.000Z\",\"updatedTs\":\"2022-09-20T02:12:06.000Z\",\"hidden\":false,\"title\":\"20 Quotes About the Mystery of Memory\",\"slug\":\"20-quotes-about-the-mystery-of-memory\",\"html\":\"<p>Memory: that slippery beast that dictates not just the moments we recall from our lives, but the very narrative we live by.
