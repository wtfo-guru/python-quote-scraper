The <a href=\\\"https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/paraprosdokian\\\">Macmillan Dictionary</a> defines a paraprosdokian as \u201ca figure of speech in which the latter part of a sentence or phrase is surprising or unexpected in a way that causes the reader or listener to re-frame or re-interpret the first part.\u201d It\u2019s a strange word, but in Greek \u2014 from which it derives \u2014 it makes perfect sense: It comes from \u201c\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac,\u201d meaning \u201cagainst\u201d or \u201cdespite,\u201d and \u201c\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03b4\u03bf\u03ba\u03af\u03b1,\u201d meaning \u201cexpectation.\u201d<br></p><p>One of the oldest, oft-cited paraprosdokians comes from the Greek philosopher Aristotle, <a href=\\\"https://books.google.com.pe/books?id=n3RWOsgcayoC&amp;pg=PA277&amp;dq=On+his+feet+he+wore%E2%80%A6blisters.%22+%E2%80%94Aristotle&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwifntmdjfzwAhVDHbkGHQnDBagQ6AEwAHoECAoQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=On%20his%20feet%20he%20wore%E2%80%A6blisters.%22%20%E2%80%94Aristotle&amp;f=false\\\">who wrote</a>, \u201cOn his feet he wore\u2026 blisters.\u201d \u201cBlisters,\u201d here, is the subversion of our expectations, as we\u2019d normally expect someone to be wearing shoes, or sandals, on their feet. <br></p><p>The Aristotle example isn\u2019t a side-splitter by any means, but paraprosdokians are frequently used for their comic effect by comedians and satirists. Politicians have also used paraprosdokians when looking for a laugh, whether poking fun at themselves or at others. Here are some classic examples of funny paraprosdokians, from Abraham Lincoln to Homer Simpson.</p><blockquote><br>If I were two-faced, would I be showing you this one?<br><em>\u2014 Abraham Lincoln</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Everybody laughed when I said I wanted to be a comedian.

His thirst for understanding the world seemed boundless. When his works were studied in the Middle Ages, he became known as not just <em>a</em> philosopher but \u201cThe Philosopher.\u201d In the poet Dante\u2019s 1472 epic poem <em>Divine Comedy,</em> Aristotle is called \u201cthe master of those who know.\u201d<br></p><p>Living in the fourth century B.C., Aristotle was the student of the renowned philosopher Plato and in turn became the tutor of Alexander the Great, then the prince of Macedonia. Serving at the royal courts, Aristotle became deeply concerned with how people might achieve <em>eudaimonia</em>, a Greek word meaning to flourish as a human being.

While his name is now synonymous with animation, the storytelling visionary initially got his start as an illustrator, with a dream of becoming a newspaper cartoonist. His life\u2019s work, of course, far exceeded his ambitions. He eventually branched out into feature-length animated and live-action films, television shows, nature documentaries, theme parks, and merchandise, all based on his beloved \u2014 and enduring \u2014 characters. </p><p>But like many other great success stories, Disney\u2019s journey didn\u2019t start out so glamorous. He encountered several delays along the way, including bankruptcy, trademark issues, and even a brief service during World War I. But none of that stopped him from believing in his dream, and always encouraging others to do the same. </p><p>Throughout his life, Disney created magic for people of all ages \u2014 and he continues to do so through the remarkable legacy he left behind. Read on to learn more about the inspiring life and mind of one of the most iconic figures of the 20th century.</p><p></p><blockquote>All our dreams can come true \u2014 if we have the courage to pursue them.</blockquote><p></p><p>Walt Disney was born Walter Elias Disney in Chicago, Illinois, on December 5, 1901. When he was five years old, the family \u2014 including Walt, his parents, and his four siblings \u2014 moved to a farm near Marceline, Missouri. It left a mark on young Disney, and he would carry the inspiration with him forever, even <a href=\\\"https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/marceline-missouri-lost-disney-park/index.html\\\">paying tribute</a> to his idyllic Midwestern boyhood when he built Disneyland\u2019s Main Street, USA.</p><p>The Disney family moved again to Kansas City, Missouri, in 1911, and then back to Chicago in 1917. By then, Walt had begun studying art in his spare time, and started pursuing his dream job as a cartoonist, drawing pictures for his high school newspaper. In 1918, Disney\u2019s career ambitions were briefly put on hold as he traveled to France to join the Red Cross in the Ambulance Corps during World War I.<br></p><p><br></p><blockquote>The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>Upon his return to the U.S. in 1919, Disney, still only 18 years old, moved back to Kansas City, where he got his first job at a commercial art studio. He met and befriended animator Ub Iwerks and the two quickly formed their own commercial art company. It lasted only one month, but Disney\u2019s relationship with Iwerks would remain one of the most important in his life.</p><p>Disney found employment at another ad company and brought Iwerks with him. But Disney couldn\u2019t tame his entrepreneurial spirit. He and Iwerks started a new film studio, Laugh-O-gram Films, producing cartoon shorts and experimenting with animation and live action in a popular silent series called the <em>Alice Comedies</em>. One year later, in 1923, the studio lost its financing and went bankrupt. </p><p><br></p><blockquote>We keep moving forward, opening up new doors and doing new things, because we're curious. And curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.<br></blockquote><p></p><p>Disney\u2019s next move was to Los Angeles, California, where his brother Roy already lived. His plan was to try to make it as a director, and he did just that after securing a deal with Universal Pictures to make a full <em>Alice Comedies </em>series. Walt, the creative, and Roy, the businessman, founded the Disney Brothers Studio as a result.</p><p><br></p><blockquote>I always like to look on the optimistic side of life, but I am realistic enough to know that life is a complex matter.<br></blockquote><p></p><p>Disney soon recruited his old friend Iwerks to move to Los Angeles and help with animation at the new studio.

While his name is now synonymous with animation, the storytelling visionary initially got his start as an illustrator, with a dream of becoming a newspaper cartoonist. His life\u2019s work, of course, far exceeded his ambitions. He eventually branched out into feature-length animated and live-action films, television shows, nature documentaries, theme parks, and merchandise, all based on his beloved \u2014 and enduring \u2014 characters. </p><p>But like many other great success stories, Disney\u2019s journey didn\u2019t start out so glamorous. He encountered several delays along the way, including bankruptcy, trademark issues, and even a brief service during World War I. But none of that stopped him from believing in his dream, and always encouraging others to do the same. </p><p>Throughout his life, Disney created magic for people of all ages \u2014 and he continues to do so through the remarkable legacy he left behind. Read on to learn more about the inspiring life and mind of one of the most iconic figures of the 20th century.</p><p></p><blockquote>All our dreams can come true \u2014 if we have the courage to pursue them.</blockquote><p></p><p>Walt Disney was born Walter Elias Disney in Chicago, Illinois, on December 5, 1901. When he was five years old, the family \u2014 including Walt, his parents, and his four siblings \u2014 moved to a farm near Marceline, Missouri. It left a mark on young Disney, and he would carry the inspiration with him forever, even <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/marceline-missouri-lost-disney-park/index.html\\\">paying tribute</a> to his idyllic Midwestern boyhood when he built Disneyland\u2019s Main Street, USA.</p><p>The Disney family moved again to Kansas City, Missouri, in 1911, and then back to Chicago in 1917. By then, Walt had begun studying art in his spare time, and started pursuing his dream job as a cartoonist, drawing pictures for his high school newspaper. In 1918, Disney\u2019s career ambitions were briefly put on hold as he traveled to France to join the Red Cross in the Ambulance Corps during World War I.<br></p><p><br></p><blockquote>The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>Upon his return to the U.S. in 1919, Disney, still only 18 years old, moved back to Kansas City, where he got his first job at a commercial art studio. He met and befriended animator Ub Iwerks and the two quickly formed their own commercial art company. It lasted only one month, but Disney\u2019s relationship with Iwerks would remain one of the most important in his life.</p><p>Disney found employment at another ad company and brought Iwerks with him. But Disney couldn\u2019t tame his entrepreneurial spirit. He and Iwerks started a new film studio, Laugh-O-gram Films, producing cartoon shorts and experimenting with animation and live action in a popular silent series called the <em>Alice Comedies</em>. One year later, in 1923, the studio lost its financing and went bankrupt. </p><p><br></p><blockquote>We keep moving forward, opening up new doors and doing new things, because we're curious. And curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.<br></blockquote><p></p><p>Disney\u2019s next move was to Los Angeles, California, where his brother Roy already lived. His plan was to try to make it as a director, and he did just that after securing a deal with Universal Pictures to make a full <em>Alice Comedies </em>series. Walt, the creative, and Roy, the businessman, founded the Disney Brothers Studio as a result.</p><p><br></p><blockquote>I always like to look on the optimistic side of life, but I am realistic enough to know that life is a complex matter.<br></blockquote><p></p><p>Disney soon recruited his old friend Iwerks to move to Los Angeles and help with animation at the new studio. The company grew, and by 1927, Disney was asked to create a new character for Universal following the success of <em>Alice Comedies</em>. Together, Disney and Iwerks came up with a personality-filled bunny who was known as Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. It became Universal\u2019s biggest animated hit.

In the decades since, the United States has undergone a marked and hard-worn shift in civil rights and the opportunities available to Black women. In 1992, Mae Jemison became the first Black woman to go into space, and in 2021, about 200 years after Tubman\u2019s birth, Kamala Harris became the first woman and first Black American to serve as Vice President of the United States.</p><p>The journey for Black women has been long and difficult, but progress continues to be made thanks to the countless inspirational women who have fought for equality as activists and politicians, and empowered generations through their writing, music, and art. Here are some of those voices, spanning two centuries of resilience, courage, and achievement.</p><p></p><blockquote>I was the conductor of the Underground Railroad for eight years, and I can say what most conductors can\u2019t say \u2014 I never ran my train off the track and I never lost a passenger.<br><em>\u2014 Harriet Tubman</em></blockquote><p>Following Harriet Tubman\u2019s escape from slavery, she made more than a dozen missions with the Underground Railroad, rescuing some 70 enslaved people, including her immediate family. Later, she became an activist in the women's suffrage movement.</p><p></p><blockquote>People always say that I didn\u2019t give up my seat because I was tired, but that isn\u2019t true. I was not tired physically\u2026 No, the only tired I was, was tired of giving in.<br><em>\u2014 Rosa Parks</em></blockquote><p>When Rosa Parks refused an order to vacate her bus seat for a white passenger, she became a pivotal figure in the Montgomery bus boycott of the civil rights movement, and in turn, an international icon of resistance to racial segregation.</p><p></p><blockquote>The air is the only place free from prejudice.<br><em>\u2014 Bessie Coleman</em></blockquote><p>Aviator Bessie Coleman grew up working in cotton fields but always dreamed of flying. So, she saved some money and went to flight school in France, becoming the first African American woman and Native American to obtain a pilot license. She went on to become a high-profile pilot in dangerous air shows \u2014 she would perform only if the crowd was desegregated and permitted to enter through the same gates.</p><p></p><blockquote>I guess what everyone wants more than anything else is to be loved. And to know that you loved me for my singing is too much for me. Forgive me if I don't have all the words. Maybe I can sing it and you'll understand.<br><em>\u2014 Ella Fitzgerald</em></blockquote><p>Ella Fitzgerald was painfully shy in social situations, but on stage she let her songs speak for her in dazzling fashion. During her career, the Queen of Jazz won 14 Grammy Awards and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p><p></p><blockquote>If they don\u2019t give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair.<br><em>\u2014 Shirley Chisholm</em></blockquote><p>In 1968, Shirley Chisholm became the first Black woman elected to the United States Congress, and in 1972 she became the first Black candidate to run for a major party's nomination for President of the United States. She was a woman who, in her own words, \u201cdared to be a catalyst of change.\u201d</p><p></p><blockquote>We were pioneers of the space era\u2026 Everything was so new \u2014 the whole idea of going into space was new and daring. There were no textbooks, so we had to write them.<br><em>\u2014 Katherine Johnson</em></blockquote><p>Katherine Johnson was a mathematician whose calculations of orbital mechanics were critical to NASA\u2019s first and subsequent crewed spaceflights. Her sheer talent and ceaseless enthusiasm made her indispensable, despite the racial and gender barriers she faced.</p><p></p><blockquote>It is not our differences that divide us, it is our inability to recognize, accept, and celebrate those differences.<br><em>\u2014 Audre Lorde</em></blockquote><p>Writer, feminist, and civil rights activist Audre Lorde was known for her passionate writings on lesbian feminism and racial issues. She often introduced herself as \u201ca Black, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet.\u201d</p><p></p><blockquote>When I began writing science fiction, when I began reading, heck, I wasn't in any of this stuff I read. The only Black people you found were occasional characters or characters who were so feeble-witted that they couldn't manage anything, anyway. I wrote myself in, since I'm me and I'm here and I'm writing.<br><em>\u2014 Octavia Butler</em></blockquote><p>Octavia Butler paved the way for African American women in science fiction, a genre traditionally dominated by white males. Her unsentimental and frank examinations of race, sex and power earned her multiple Hugo and Nebula awards, and her work helped to develop the genre of Afrofuturism.</p><p></p><blockquote>The thing to do, it seems to me, is to prepare yourself so you can be a rainbow in somebody else's cloud. Somebody who may not look like you. May not call God the same name you call God \u2014 if they call God at all. I may not dance your dances or speak your language. But be a blessing to somebody. That's what I think.<br>\u2014 Maya Angelou</blockquote><p>Poet, memoirist, actress, director, lecturer, civil rights activist \u2014 Maya Angelou was a multifaceted woman of many talents. She is best known for her series of autobiographies, starting with 1969\u2019s <em>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</em>.</p><p></p><blockquote>The most healthy thing is to be true to your own self\u2026 but also, that you have a right to express what you see and what you feel and what you think. To be bold. To be as bold with your vision as you can possibly be.<br><em>\u2014 Alice Walker</em></blockquote><p>In 1982, Alice Walker became the first Black American woman to win the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, for her novel <em>The Color Purple</em>.</p><p></p><blockquote>Once I got into space, I was feeling very comfortable in the universe. I felt like I had a right to be anywhere in this universe, that I belonged here as much as any speck of stardust, any comet, any planet.<br><em>\u2014 Mae Jemison</em></blockquote><p>In 1992, NASA astronaut Mae Jemison became the first Black woman to travel into space. She served as a mission specialist aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour, orbiting Earth 127 times during her eight-day mission.</p><p></p><p>Photo credit: Glasshouse Images/ Alamy Stock Photo</p>\",\"htmlChunks\":[\"<p>In 1822, Harriet Tubman was born into slavery.

She often introduced herself as \u201ca Black, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet.\u201d</p><p></p><blockquote>When I began writing science fiction, when I began reading, heck, I wasn't in any of this stuff I read. The only Black people you found were occasional characters or characters who were so feeble-witted that they couldn't manage anything, anyway. I wrote myself in, since I'm me and I'm here and I'm writing.<br><em>\u2014 Octavia Butler</em></blockquote><p>Octavia Butler paved the way for African American women in science fiction, a genre traditionally dominated by white males.

Somebody who may not look like you. May not call God the same name you call God \u2014 if they call God at all. I may not dance your dances or speak your language. But be a blessing to somebody. That's what I think.<br>\u2014 Maya Angelou</blockquote><p>Poet, memoirist, actress, director, lecturer, civil rights activist \u2014 Maya Angelou was a multifaceted woman of many talents.

Being a good listener allows us to better understand those around us, to see through their eyes, to empathize, and ultimately, to understand ourselves better in turn. Studies have shown that people who listen well have stronger relationships, are better at anticipating problems, and resolve conflicts (when they do arise) with more tact and empathy.</p><p>We can practice listening any time we wish, even if there isn\u2019t anyone else around. Try it right now. Close your eyes and notice what you hear. Sounds will present themselves in even the quietest of places, if we are patient and observant enough to hear them. The next time you\u2019re outside, count how many sounds you can hear. Then take your honed listening skills with you into your next conversation, truly paying attention to what\u2019s being said. </p><p>Listening is a practice of generosity.

No matter what our culture.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>My mother always said, \u201cIf you really want something, you\u2019re going to have to work hard, you\u2019ll have to take advantage of every opportunity, but don\u2019t give up.\u201d</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Chimpanzees have given me so much. The long hours spent with them in the forest have enriched my life beyond measure. What I have learned from them has shaped my understanding of human behavior, of our place in nature.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>The greatest danger to our future is apathy.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>We are unique.

A visually striking, expertly stylized, and intellectually complex period drama, the AMC series starts in 1960 and follows the employees of Sterling Cooper, an advertising firm on Madison Avenue in Manhattan. As the decade unfolds, the corporate world of advertising \u2014 and the rest of American society \u2014 grapples with and is changed by the rising counterculture and social movements of the era. </p><p>Although its nostalgic period details are painstaking and seductive, <em>Mad Men</em>\u2019s long-lasting appeal is also due to the ability of the writers \u2014 a team helmed by show creator Matthew Weiner \u2014 to communicate universal and timeless truths. The show doesn't shy away from controversial social issues in American culture \u2014 both then and now. For many of the characters, change was a destabilizing \u00a0force that they had to learn to accept, or else get left behind. Don, Betty, Roger, Peggy, Joan, and the other unforgettably nuanced characters in the show \u2014 many of them unlikable by design \u2014 all faced serious challenges that allowed them to change and grow \u2014 and muse about the nature of life along the way. <em>Mad Men </em>was never about just advertising, and here are 22 quotes that show just how deep the show can get.</p><p></p><blockquote>If they\u2019ve tried to make you feel you\u2019re different from them, you are. That\u2019s a good way to be.<br><em>\u2014 Joan Harris (Christina Hendricks)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Make it simple, but significant.<br><em>\u2014 Don Draper (Jon Hamm)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Dissatisfaction is a symptom of ambition. It\u2019s the coal that fuels the fire.<br><em>\u2014 Trudy Campbell (Alison Brie)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>People will show you who they are, but we ignore it because we want them to be who we want them to be.<br><em>\u2014 Don Draper (Jon Hamm)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>We're flawed because we want so much more. We're ruined because we get these things and wish for what we had.<br><em>\u2014 Don Draper (Jon Hamm)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>She was born in 1898 in a barn. She died on the 37th floor of a skyscraper. She's an astronaut.<br><em>\u2014 Bert Cooper (Robert Morse)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>At some point, we\u2019ve all parked in the wrong garage.<br><em>\u2014 Roger Sterling (John Slattery)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>For a lot of people, love isn\u2019t just a slogan.<br><em>\u2014 Rachel Menken (Maggie Siff)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Young men love risk because they can\u2019t imagine the consequences.<br><em>\u2014 Bert Cooper (Robert Morse)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>One never knows how loyalty is born.<br><em>\u2014 Bert Cooper (Robert Morse)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>You're painting a masterpiece, make sure to hide the brushstrokes.<br><em>\u2014 Betty Draper (January Jones)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>You think you\u2019re going to begin your life over and do it right, but what if you never get past the beginning again?<br><em>\u2014 Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Because I want love. And I\u2019d rather die hoping that happens than make some arrangement.

Happiness is the smell of a new car. It's freedom from fear. It's a billboard on the side of the road that screams reassurance that whatever you are doing is okay. You are okay.<br><em>\u2014 Don Draper (Jon Hamm)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>You\u2019re never gonna get that corner office until you start treating Don as an equal.

Powerful business when done correctly.<br><em>\u2014 Bobbie Barrett (Melinda McGraw)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>If you don\u2019t like what\u2019s being said, change the conversation.<br><em>\u2014 Don Draper (Jon Hamm)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>That\u2019s life.

A visually striking, expertly stylized, and intellectually complex period drama, the AMC series starts in 1960 and follows the employees of Sterling Cooper, an advertising firm on Madison Avenue in Manhattan. As the decade unfolds, the corporate world of advertising \u2014 and the rest of American society \u2014 grapples with and is changed by the rising counterculture and social movements of the era. </p><p>Although its nostalgic period details are painstaking and seductive, <em>Mad Men</em>\u2019s long-lasting appeal is also due to the ability of the writers \u2014 a team helmed by show creator Matthew Weiner \u2014 to communicate universal and timeless truths. The show doesn't shy away from controversial social issues in American culture \u2014 both then and now. For many of the characters, change was a destabilizing \u00a0force that they had to learn to accept, or else get left behind. Don, Betty, Roger, Peggy, Joan, and the other unforgettably nuanced characters in the show \u2014 many of them unlikable by design \u2014 all faced serious challenges that allowed them to change and grow \u2014 and muse about the nature of life along the way. <em>Mad Men </em>was never about just advertising, and here are 22 quotes that show just how deep the show can get.</p><p></p><blockquote>If they\u2019ve tried to make you feel you\u2019re different from them, you are. That\u2019s a good way to be.<br><em>\u2014 Joan Harris (Christina Hendricks)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Make it simple, but significant.<br><em>\u2014 Don Draper (Jon Hamm)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Dissatisfaction is a symptom of ambition. It\u2019s the coal that fuels the fire.<br><em>\u2014 Trudy Campbell (Alison Brie)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>People will show you who they are, but we ignore it because we want them to be who we want them to be.<br><em>\u2014 Don Draper (Jon Hamm)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>We're flawed because we want so much more. We're ruined because we get these things and wish for what we had.<br><em>\u2014 Don Draper (Jon Hamm)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>She was born in 1898 in a barn. She died on the 37th floor of a skyscraper. She's an astronaut.<br><em>\u2014 Bert Cooper (Robert Morse)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>At some point, we\u2019ve all parked in the wrong garage.<br><em>\u2014 Roger Sterling (John Slattery)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>For a lot of people, love isn\u2019t just a slogan.<br><em>\u2014 Rachel Menken (Maggie Siff)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Young men love risk because they can\u2019t imagine the consequences.<br><em>\u2014 Bert Cooper (Robert Morse)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>One never knows how loyalty is born.<br><em>\u2014 Bert Cooper (Robert Morse)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>You're painting a masterpiece, make sure to hide the brushstrokes.<br><em>\u2014 Betty Draper (January Jones)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>You think you\u2019re going to begin your life over and do it right, but what if you never get past the beginning again?<br><em>\u2014 Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Because I want love. And I\u2019d rather die hoping that happens than make some arrangement. And you should too.<br><em>\u2014 Joan Harris (Christina Hendricks)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Just think about it deeply, then forget it, and an idea will jump up in your face.<br><em>\u2014 Don Draper (Jon Hamm)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>You know what happiness is? Happiness is the smell of a new car. It's freedom from fear. It's a billboard on the side of the road that screams reassurance that whatever you are doing is okay. You are okay.<br><em>\u2014 Don Draper (Jon Hamm)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>You\u2019re never gonna get that corner office until you start treating Don as an equal. And no one will tell you this, but you can\u2019t be a man. Don\u2019t even try. Be a woman. Powerful business when done correctly.<br><em>\u2014 Bobbie Barrett (Melinda McGraw)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>If you don\u2019t like what\u2019s being said, change the conversation.<br><em>\u2014 Don Draper (Jon Hamm)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>That\u2019s life. One minute you\u2019re on top of the world, the next minute some secretary\u2019s running you over with a lawn mower.<br><em>\u2014 Joan Harris (Christina Hendricks)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>You\u2019re going to have a lot of first kisses. You\u2019re going to want it to be special, so you\u2019ll remember. It\u2019s where you go from being a stranger to knowing someone.<br><em>\u2014 Betty Draper (January Jones)</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>You want some respect?

Having joined a monastery at age 16 in 1942, the spiritual leader spent most of his life studying, practicing, and spreading the Buddhist principles of nonviolence and awareness. He was an author, poet, artist, and peace activist with a gift for distilling ancient Buddhist philosophies into accessible daily practices. His teachings helped people all around the world to slow down, catch their breath, and enjoy the present moment.</p><p>Over the course of his long life, Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh wrote more than 70 books and founded several Buddhist movements and organizations, most notably the Plum Village monastery and mindfulness center in southern France. During the Vietnam War, he developed a practice of \u201cengaged Buddhism,\u201d which unites personal spirituality and social action, inspiring people to demonstrate against war, rebuild villages, provide medical treatment, and advocate for human rights. These actions led to his exile from his home country for 39 years, during which he traveled the world spreading the message of peace and love. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. called Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh \u201can apostle of peace and nonviolence\u201d when he nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize in 1967.</p><p>In his nineties, Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh returned to his native country to live at the monastery where he was first ordained as a teen, in the central Vietnam city of Hu\u1ebf. His work continues to inspire, offering a simple and inviting approach to meditation and Buddhism. His equanimous and caring style is evident in these 15 calming quotes from the Zen master\u2019s life\u2019s work.</p><p></p><blockquote>Breathing in, I calm my body.

Having joined a monastery at age 16 in 1942, the spiritual leader spent most of his life studying, practicing, and spreading the Buddhist principles of nonviolence and awareness. He was an author, poet, artist, and peace activist with a gift for distilling ancient Buddhist philosophies into accessible daily practices. His teachings helped people all around the world to slow down, catch their breath, and enjoy the present moment.</p><p>Over the course of his long life, Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh wrote more than 70 books and founded several Buddhist movements and organizations, most notably the Plum Village monastery and mindfulness center in southern France. During the Vietnam War, he developed a practice of \u201cengaged Buddhism,\u201d which unites personal spirituality and social action, inspiring people to demonstrate against war, rebuild villages, provide medical treatment, and advocate for human rights. These actions led to his exile from his home country for 39 years, during which he traveled the world spreading the message of peace and love. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. called Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh \u201can apostle of peace and nonviolence\u201d when he nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize in 1967.</p><p>In his nineties, Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh returned to his native country to live at the monastery where he was first ordained as a teen, in the central Vietnam city of Hu\u1ebf. His work continues to inspire, offering a simple and inviting approach to meditation and Buddhism. His equanimous and caring style is evident in these 15 calming quotes from the Zen master\u2019s life\u2019s work.</p><p></p><blockquote>Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I smile.<br><em>\u2014 \\\"Being Peace\\\"</em></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>You can see everything in the universe in one tangerine.

It can be easy to forget this amid the uncertainties and hardships of day-to-day living, but if we make an effort to always look for the lighter side of things, we can find moments of levity on even the worst days. As cliche as it may sound, laughter truly is the best medicine in many cases; when it feels like frustration is the only rational response, taking a step back and seeing the humor in a situation can release the tension of the moment, freeing us up to address the issue from a different angle.</p><p>As writer and philosopher Elbert Hubbard famously said, \u201cDo not take life too seriously.

Born Frances Ethel Gumm, she got her start in a vaudeville family act, going on stage as early as age two, and later creating a singing duo with one of her sisters. That landed her the chance to audition for MGM Studios as a teenager, which led to iconic roles in such classic musicals as <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, <em>Meet Me in St. Louis</em>, <em>Summer Stock</em>, and many more.

Garland was aware, in her lifetime, of how beloved she was by her audiences \u2014 even as she found it challenging to love herself.

It is so symbolic of all dreams and wishes that I'm sure that's why people sometimes get tears in their eyes when they hear it.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>I'm always being painted a more tragic figure than I am. Actually, I get awfully bored with myself as a tragic figure.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Not many of us have the names or identities we were born with. I don't associate Frances Gumm with me...

Time won\u2019t stop and life won\u2019t stand still.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>I believe that if you are lonely sometimes, you should accept it, without feeling that life has treated you badly. There are lonely moments in all lives. Even when you are in a crowd, a feeling of loneliness can wash over you. Remember that other people in the same crowd may be feeling the same way.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Why do people insist on seeing an aura of tragedy around me always? My life isn\u2019t tragic at all. I laugh a lot these days. At myself, too. Lord, if I couldn\u2019t laugh at myself I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be alive.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>I've never looked through a keyhole without finding someone was looking back.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>A really great reception makes me feel like I have a great big warm heating pad all over me. People en masse have always been wonderful to me. I truly have a great love for an audience, and I used to want to prove it to them by giving them blood.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>The only time I felt wanted when I was a kid was when I was on stage, performing. The stage was my only friend \u2014 the only place where I felt alive and comfortable and safe.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>I'm a woman who wants to reach out and take 40 million people in her arms.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>I can live without money, but I cannot live without love.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>You must remember that over the years, multitudes of people have shown me a great deal of love and loyalty, a very, very deep love...

And I've spent my entire life trying to get over it.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Always be a first-rate version of yourself, instead of a second-rate version of somebody else.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if we could all be a little more gentle with each other, and a little more loving, have a little more empathy, and maybe we'd like each other a little bit more.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>As for my feelings toward \\\"Over the Rainbow,\\\" it's become part of my life. It is so symbolic of all dreams and wishes that I'm sure that's why people sometimes get tears in their eyes when they hear it.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>I'm always being painted a more tragic figure than I am. Actually, I get awfully bored with myself as a tragic figure.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Not many of us have the names or identities we were born with. I don't associate Frances Gumm with me... I, Judy Garland, was born when I was 12 years old.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>I don't always have to sing a song\u2026 There's a woman. There are three children. There's me! There's a lot of life going here.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>It sounds like the most Pollyanna thing to say, but it is truly worth it \u2014 the heartbreak and the disappointments \u2014 when you can walk out and help hundreds of people enjoy themselves.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>There are about 15 years that you can be young. All the rest, you are a grown-up. I think you appreciate being a grown-up much better, if you don\u2019t try to be that way too soon.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>I know, now, that it is a mistake, for most of us, to get success too quickly. I know it is better to go slowly and surely, I know it is good for us to get a few knocks on the chin.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>I wanted to stay like Dorothy in <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>. Life wasn\u2019t as complicated then. But I can\u2019t help growing up. No one can. Time won\u2019t stop and life won\u2019t stand still.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>I believe that if you are lonely sometimes, you should accept it, without feeling that life has treated you badly. There are lonely moments in all lives. Even when you are in a crowd, a feeling of loneliness can wash over you. Remember that other people in the same crowd may be feeling the same way.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Why do people insist on seeing an aura of tragedy around me always? My life isn\u2019t tragic at all. I laugh a lot these days. At myself, too. Lord, if I couldn\u2019t laugh at myself I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be alive.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>I've never looked through a keyhole without finding someone was looking back.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>A really great reception makes me feel like I have a great big warm heating pad all over me. People en masse have always been wonderful to me. I truly have a great love for an audience, and I used to want to prove it to them by giving them blood.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>The only time I felt wanted when I was a kid was when I was on stage, performing. The stage was my only friend \u2014 the only place where I felt alive and comfortable and safe.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>I'm a woman who wants to reach out and take 40 million people in her arms.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>I can live without money, but I cannot live without love.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>You must remember that over the years, multitudes of people have shown me a great deal of love and loyalty, a very, very deep love... Some writers said I was through but, by God, the audiences came and bolstered me.</blockquote><p></p><p>Photo credit: Pictorial Press Ltd/ Alamy Stock Photo<br></p>\"],\"excerpt\":\"Judy Garland was aware, in her lifetime, of how beloved she was by her audiences \u2014 even as she found it challenging to find her way \\\"over the rainbow.\\\"\",\"imageUrl\":\"https://imgblog.inspiringquotes.com/2022/05/SILO-judy.jpeg\",\"featured\":false,\"tags\":[{\"_id\":\"60536eceb411db0006940f87\",\"slug\":\"entertainment\",\"name\":\"entertainment\",\"visible\":true,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":true,\"url\":\"/tag/entertainment\"},{\"_id\":\"602d36c0b411db0006940941\",\"slug\":\"hope\",\"name\":\"hope\",\"visible\":true,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":false,\"url\":\"/tag/hope\"},{\"_id\":\"60259447012afd0006cfde28\",\"slug\":\"music\",\"name\":\"music\",\"visible\":true,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null,\"meta\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"og\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null},\"twitter\":{\"title\":null,\"description\":null,\"imageUrl\":null}},\"primary\":false,\"url\":\"/tag/music\"}],\"authors\":[{\"_id\":\"62965f0b1461a600079c2c7b\",\"name\":\"Courtney E.
